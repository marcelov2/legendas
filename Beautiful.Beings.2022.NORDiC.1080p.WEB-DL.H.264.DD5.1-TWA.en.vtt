00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.436
I once dreamed
that I was going with my friends

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.200
to beat up a guy that had done something.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.756
I was furious and thought he deserved it.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.480
But then I sensed how scared he'd be
and wanted to back out.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:20.355
I looked at my friends
and knew they would turn against me.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.836
They would need
to get their anger out someway.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.596
I kept on going
but then a huge eagle came down

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.836
and grabbed me.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.040
He carried me across the city, out
to the open sea, and dropped me there.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.120
I tried to swim but instead I sank

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.079
and started drowning.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.235
When someone lifted me up out of the sea,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.359
and a giant woman
made of endless colors appeared.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.396
She held me in the palms of her hands,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.599
smiled and wanted to show me
all the colors of the world.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.719
BEAUTIFUL BEINGS

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.835
That is number one:

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.919
Who is the main character of the story?

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.199
Sit down, Baldur.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.235
Number one:

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.555
Who is the main character of the story
and what do you know about him?

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.515
When did you get information
about the main character's situation?

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.716
What did the descriptions...

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.476
Hey! Stop that.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.159
What? He really stinks.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.400
Describe the boy's communication...

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.520
Balli!

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.996
Dude.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.156
Show us how you scream.
Scream for us or I'll hurt you.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.039
- Hit him harder.
- Scream.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.680
Scream, you idiot. Scream!

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.395
- Scream!
- Go on, just do it.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.719
Are you retarded? I'll fuck you up.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.839
Poor thing. So weird!

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.000
It's beyond hilarious.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.439
Yes, I know.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.000
Of course not. I... I love you.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.439
I do too.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.079
No, I know.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.759
I'm sorry.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.199
Hey, what's up?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.839
Come over here a second.
It's nice to see you.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.279
If my stepdad found out
what you did, he'd kill you all.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:57.879
Put the jacket on.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Dude, put the jacket on
or I'll beat you up.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:11.120
Dude. What the fuck are you doing?
Are you retarded?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.675
<i>Police report show that violence
among young people in Iceland</i>

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:43.115
<i>is a rising issue
especially in the capital area.</i>

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.675
<i>Do we really know what's going on
in our children's lives?</i>

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.755
<i>Today, a 14 year old boy was

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:54.596

<i>Spotlight continues its coverage

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:05.720
I can't believe this is happening here.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:08.359
I hope he's going to be alright.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.680
He's just some total nerd.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.956
What's wrong with you?
How can you say that?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040
Just look at him!

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.769
Who else would be beaten up like that
and then show himself on TV?

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:21.199
I don't care if you...

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:26.879
like me or not,
I just want to be left alone.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.396
Most of you made between
four and eight errors.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.559
And then there's Arnar,
with a total of 43 errors.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.756
- What are you doing, man?
- I won't be needing it anymore.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.916
- You have to return it.
- I'll just say I lost it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.876
Well, your mom will have to pay for it.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.960
Fuck.

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:06.195
- Fuck.
- You're so stupid.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.399
Shut up.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:13.555
- Hey, give me your book for a second.
- No way.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:15.120
Come on, just give it to me.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.435
Addi, some dude is threatening
to beat me up.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:21.835
- Who?
- Jónas from eastside.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:22.955
Why?

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:26.559
I swapped spit with his girlfriend
long ago. Guess he just found out.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:32.195
- Dude, what were you thinking?
- What? He's a pedophile.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.000
He's like 17 and she is 13.
He's got a full-on beard and everything.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.279
And you got with her anyway?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.000
She's only a year younger than us.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.190
You'll back me up if he comes
and makes trouble.

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.559
No bullshit.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:55.480
Hey, give me a cig.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.240
Hey, check out this guy.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.720
Siggi, you should get one of those.
You're so goddamn ugly.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.919
Shut up.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.360
What are you doing?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.270
Aren't you the guy from TV
who got attacked?

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.990
Are you trying to cut yourself?

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.116
Are you stupid or what?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.879
Exactly, stupid.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.440
Got a cig?

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:14.919
What's in it?

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:28.636
- Ew, what the hell.
- It works.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.159
Disgusting.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.360
Drink up.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.120
Go on, finish it.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720
Wow, dude!

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.919
Well done!

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:03.080
Shit, what have you done, man?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.276
- Come on, we'll get you home.
- Please don't.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.440
Just leave him, he'll puke all over us.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.240
Are you okay?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.320
It's a bum house.

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:45.639
I see why he wants to kill himself.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:54.080
I decide who is welcome.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.480
And you're not welcome.

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:04.116
This is my home and
only those who I invite,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.195
they are welcome. Nothing else.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:09.036
What are you doing?

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.475
What? Nothing.

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:14.000
- Were you talking to that thing?
- No.

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:18.320
- Give it.
- Please. Addi.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.080
- Shit, you're crazy.
- Addi!

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:26.759
Addi.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.360
Your idiot father took this
without asking me...

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:37.000
Leave me alone!

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:24.320
Jónas and some guys are looking for me.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.440
Imagine what they'll say about us
if we don't dare to do anything?

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.000
Fuck with me or my friends again
and I'll kill you!

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.240
Yeah! Yeah!

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.799
I said, get up!

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:58.075
- Are you fucking retarded or what?
- I told you a hundred times, get up!

00:15:58.159 --> 00:15:59.475
I'm not putting up with it.

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:03.320
Out every night and then sleeping
through the whole day.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.000
Leave me alone.

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:14.240
So get up then.

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:19.955
Arnar!

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:21.960
Leave me the fuck alone!

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:04.039
Abba, go!

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.480
Hi.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.519
Hi.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.910
Sorry, I don't have any cigarettes now.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.960
Abba, stop it. Go away, stupid dog.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.279
It's fine. She's just happy to see me.

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:08.955
- Want a butt?
- Butt?

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.675
Yeah. I've got some good ones.

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:14.159
Mom sometimes forgets she's smoking
a cigarette and lights a new one.

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:26.279
Why are all the doors broken?

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:31.995
My stepdad gets real crazy sometimes,
and then...

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.475
He's not coming home soon or?

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:37.799
No. He's in jail.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.076
For what?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.755
For beating up some guys
and some other stuff.

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.039
What other stuff?

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.839
Don't know. I don't think he did it.

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:03.675
- Where's your mom?
- She's with some girlfriends.

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:07.035
She won't be home until tomorrow
or the day after, at the earliest.

00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:08.240
So you're home alone?

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:14.039
It's not that bad.

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.279
Who cooks for you then?

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:31.195
She buys food before she leaves,
but I'm almost out now.

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:33.759
I just hope
she gets her ass back home soon.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:58.119
Last night, I dreamed that I was moving
into a huge house,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.519
almost like a castle.
It means I'll be rich soon.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.079
You have to remind me
to play the lottery.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.730
Why don't you just dream the numbers?

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:16.799
- I believe you.
- Come here, you little monster.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.240
Here.

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:44.160
- So fucking ugly.
- Jeez.

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:53.680
Konni, check it out.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.519
Don't fuck with me. Get up.

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:15.259
Why's it so fucking dirty in here?

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:18.160
Does your mom never clean up?

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:22.960
Ew, what's that?

00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:25.680
It's poop.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.440
- No.
- Yes, it is!

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.960
No, it's puke from my dog, Abba.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.319
- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.960
You don't know?
Why don't you clean it up?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.319
Why should I clean it up?

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:47.316
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with your mom?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.450
Hey, leave it, Siggi.

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:50.715
Okay, let's go.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:52.916
No, dude, let's chill for a bit.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.079
It's not like someone knows we're here.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.160
Come here.

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:33.119
Why's your eye so weird?

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:42.559
Shit!

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:45.119
No way, man!

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:51.316
- I lost it when I was four.
- How?

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.475
BB gun.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:55.755
My stepdad shot me, right in the eye.
He didn't know it was loaded.

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:58.089
He probably just didn't want
such an ugly kid.

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:07.755
- Where's your dad?
- He's dead.

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:08.839
How did he die?

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880
He drowned.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.039
He took LSD and thought he was Jesus
or something.

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.160
Thought he could walk on water.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.519
What?!

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:27.369
Just some things I grabbed from home.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.156
- Okay, let's go now.
- Relax, man.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.519
No, it's disgusting here
and I don't want to get lice. Let's go.

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.359
You coming, or what?

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:46.960
Come on.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.279
Come on, I'm inviting you. Let's go.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.440
Hey...

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:37.195
It's no big deal.
Just take one step at a time

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.720
and don't look down.

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.636
Dude, don't.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.000
- Go on. Do it.
- Shut up, pig face.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.000
Aw, dude.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.079
Look at that poor thing.

00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:12.839
Hey! Want some?

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.160
Why are you dragging that freak along
with us? He's a filthy inbred.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.720
Inbred. It's true, he's an inbred.

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:57.880
Konni is sort of the leader of the group.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.995
By far craziest.

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:03.316
The kids in the neighborhood
call him The Animal

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.039
because he likes fighting
and beating up guys.

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:14.720
He can be extremely dangerous
because he doesn't think before he acts.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.720
Girls like him, though.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.119
And he's probably slept
with most of the cute ones at school.

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:32.316
But what nobody knows except me,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.316
is that Konni is scared shitless
of his dad.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.680
Sometimes he doesn't dare to go home
until his old man's fallen asleep.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.596
Look at that gimp.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.515
You're not bringing him with us again.

00:26:58.599 --> 00:27:00.836
I don't want everyone to think
we're his friends.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.235
If Balli hangs out with us,

00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:04.916
maybe Konni will stop beating
you all the time.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.720
Shut up!

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:13.035
Siggi is the weirdo.

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:17.116
His mom has some kind of disease
and she's always wearing a silk robe.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.515
His stepdad's a wheeler-dealer

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:22.515
who's always trying to find a reason
to give Siggi a hard time

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:25.039
and make him feel unwelcome.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.156
But what his stepdad doesn't know
is that Siggi gets revenge

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.480
by jerking off the dog
and freezing its jizz in the ice cubes.

00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:49.799
Of course, he would never admit this
to anyone, but he knows that I know.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.000
BE BACK LATE TONIGHT
YOUR SISTER IS AT YLFA'S

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.559
I'm the most normal of us all.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.076
But what nobody knows about me

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.035
is that I went to an
Anada Marga play school

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:13.076
and that my parents believe
in supernatural stuff

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.079
like aliens and magic.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.156
Then my parents divorced
and Dad started drinking.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.740
And he hasn't really been in touch
that much since.

00:28:55.119 --> 00:28:56.916
Konni. Konni.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.235
What are you doing up there?
Get the fuck down.

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:02.400
It's okay. Balli's cleaning the house.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.799
- Come inside, man.
- No way, get down.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240
Come on.

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:14.960
Get the fuck down.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.000
Don't forget that.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.519
And this one too.

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:38.319
Hey, Balli...

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:54.160
What are you doing, man?

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.640
Dude. Do it to Siggi.

00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:07.279
Stop it. Do it to Siggi.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.079
No, do it to Balli.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.160
- What are you laughing at? Gimp!
- Dude... Be nice to Balli.

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:38.920
Keep cleaning, faggot!

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.160
Sorry.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.770
Guys, come over here.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920
Come here.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.840
See that boy over there.

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:19.596
- He fucked a sheep.
- No way.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.556
I swear I'm not lying. He's retarded
or something. He lives on my street.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.076
His dad works as a mailman
even though they have loads of money.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.240
Super weird, too.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.799
Konradur, is your father home?

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:36.519
I once sold him some tea
and told him it was pot.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.519
- What's his name?
- His name? Danni Braindead.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.240
Asshole.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.235
He can't come in here.

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:08.955
Relax, we're just fucking
with him a little.

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:12.839
- Dude, not so much.
- It's fine.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.990
- I don't want him to come in.
- Shut up, Balli, or we'll throw you out.

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:29.400
Fuck, man. Have some.

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:36.319
Go on. Try it.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.675
This is sugar.

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:44.519
No. Have you never done cocaine?
That's what it tastes like.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.240
- Fuck. I'm feeling the buzz.
- Me too. Shit.

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:56.039
- See.
- Told you so.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.640
Is it true that you fucked a sheep?

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:10.880
No.

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:16.119
It's okay if you've done it.
Balli's done it loads of times.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.596
I have never done it.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:23.039
Why are you lying to us?
We're your friends, aren't we?

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:32.359
- Come on, tell us. How did you do it?
- Tell us how you did it.

00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:36.880
I just grabbed it...

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.039
Yeah...

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:48.680
I knew it.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.396
You're so cool man.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.880
Have some more.

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:07.636
- Have you done something else?
- Something funny.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:12.515
- Yeah, something funny.
- You must've done something, Danni.

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:16.435
One time I tried to fuck a chicken,
but it didn't work.

00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:17.880
It was just like...

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.796
No, now you're lying.
Why are you lying to us?

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.475
- I want to go.
- Relax. We're not judging you.

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:33.079
We've done all kinds of stuff, funny shit.

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:40.599
What else have you done? Have
you done some more funny things?

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.035
I made him suck my dick one time.

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:46.236
No, he is lying.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.599
- No. It's true.
- No, it isn't true.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.796
- Yes, it is.
- No. He's lying.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.475
It's true. In school,
I made him do it, more than once.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:59.039
- At school? Ew.
- No... No it isn't true.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.236
How'd you make him do it?

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.396
In the toilet.
I'm much stronger than him.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.320
- No.
- Yes I am.

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:13.320
- It's not true.
- It is true.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.559
Get the fuck out!

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.440
- Go away.
- Why?

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:25.599
Konni, take it easy.

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:27.679
Go away!

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.039
Konni! Relax, man.

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.559
Danni, run!

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.920
He deserved it.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.559
My dad's gonna kill me.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.035
That creep lives on my street.

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:04.280
Then just tell him what he told us.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.320
Your dad's just gonna be glad
you beat him up.

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:33.760
What are you doing?

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.435
You know Balli did it.

00:36:38.519 --> 00:36:42.316
We don't know that.
Maybe that freak was just talking shit.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.440
No.

00:36:44.519 --> 00:36:49.920
Siggi, if it did happen
then we're not gonna talk about it. Okay?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.679
Boys, what are you doing in there?

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.599
- What are you doing, man?
- Move.

00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:14.639
Help me out!

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.170
- What were you thinking, man?
- Look at this.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.035
- Konni.
- Balli gave me permission to do it.

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:30.796
Balli, are you stupid or something?

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880
Balli?

00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:33.719
Shit.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.075
What's going on here?

00:37:39.159 --> 00:37:41.039
What is going on?

00:37:42.559 --> 00:37:43.920
Who are you?

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.480
- What are you doing here?
- They're my friends.

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.519
Balli, come and talk to me.

00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:15.280
Fucking assholes.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.876
I had an interesting dream last night.
About you.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.960
- What?
- It's...

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.836
When I woke up this morning,
I felt like I had to urge you

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.276
to open up to your subconscious.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.035
- You and your sister are just like me...
- Mom, I'm sorry,

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:04.995
but I don't believe in that stuff.

00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:08.035
- It's true whether you believe it or not.
- Okay, Mom.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:10.760
Thanks, Mom. I'll keep that in mind, Mom.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.079
Put away your plate.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.679
I spoke to your father yesterday.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.075
- He really wants to see you.
- I don't care.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:33.035
- He wants to see you.
- He can come round here, then.

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:35.115
No, that's not going to work.

00:39:35.199 --> 00:39:38.199
I'm not going to wait somewhere,
and then he doesn't show up.

00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:42.880
Okay, he can come and pick you up,
but I'm not inviting him in.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.115
And if I'm at work,

00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:48.155
then you're not allowed
to invite him in either.

00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:49.756
And if he does come in,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.035
make sure he doesn't take anything,
especially not my books.

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:55.676
- No matter what he says.
- Okay, relax.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.159
- These are my books. I bought them.
- He won't show up anyway.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.876
He loves you. You know that.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.199
Idiot.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.039
- Goddamn, you're ugly.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:46.319
He's definitely home,
he just doesn't want to answer.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.396
Balli, we know you're in there!

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.719
Hi. I've also been knocking.
It seems like no one's home.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.280
Are you friends with Baldur?

00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:01.595
My name is Unnur,
and I'm trying to reach his mother.

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:03.029
Have you seen her recently?

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:10.000
Hi, Baldur. So you were home after all.

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:14.199
Is your mother perhaps home too?

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:18.879
Can I come in
and have a quick word with you?

00:41:20.559 --> 00:41:22.236
No, not now.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.480
Where's your mother?

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.719
Please ask her to call me
when she gets back.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.000
Who was she?

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:35.995
Just some old hag from social services.

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:37.955
Does she come round often?

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:39.159
Yeah, sometimes.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.155
- Balli's into this kind of stuff.
- Shut up, fag.

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:06.689
You're the one who put it on.

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:15.319
Your mom's fucking weird, Balli.

00:42:23.199 --> 00:42:26.119
Balli, I'm leaving,
but I'll be back later today.

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:30.119
Don't break anything else in here, boys.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.440
Okay, Mom, just go!

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.440
Hey, Addi...

00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:58.716
Do we wanna meet Anna
and her girlfriends tonight?

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.836
Sure.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.119
I wanna come with.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.800
What about Balli?

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.840
- Stop it!
- You'll only wet your hair.

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:25.480
No!

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:33.400
Konni, we'll let you handle this one.

00:43:53.159 --> 00:43:55.199
Hey, put this on.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.120
Balli is going to
lose his virginity tonight.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.955
Hurry up!

00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:30.960
- Chill out!
- Come on, Addi!

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.480
Let's do this?

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.440
Forget it, not a chance.

00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:08.360
What, are you trying to see my boobs or?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.119
You were in my way.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.440
I've heard lots of stories about
The Animal. I thought he'd be different.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.880
He's alright.

00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:45.239
Oh, no.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.940
Ask if we can come
or if they can spare some beers.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.599
Like a cheap whore.

00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:31.880
Hi. I was wondering if me and
my girlfriends could get some beers?

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.320
Yeah, sure.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.760
What is wrong with you?

00:46:40.519 --> 00:46:43.280
That fucking retard spat on me.

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:47.239
Konni! Where are you going?
Get back here, man.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.316
Get the fuck out!

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.400
Konni! Konni!

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.800
Hey, easy, easy.

00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:09.800
I'm just trying to get him out of here.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.400
Go away! Stop it!

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.599
Konni! Leave him alone! Get off him!

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:37.559
Konni!

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.676
What the hell are you doing?

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.679
What's going on here, boys?

00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:51.839
- Get out before I call the cops.
- Shut the fuck up!

00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:54.840
Come on! Addi!

00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:58.239
Addi, now!

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:30.356
You're fucking crazy.

00:48:30.381 --> 00:48:31.936
What happened? What were you thinking?

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.836
I don't know. Oh shit,
I think I knocked some old guy out.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.760
Wow, you guys are nuts!

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.435
I heard screaming
all the way to the street.

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:43.676
Siggi and Balli were both scared shitless.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.356
Obviously. So were you. We all thought
you were gonna get battered.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.316
I almost called an ambulance.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.800
You could have done
for the guy that spat on you.

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.280
It's not fucking funny.

00:49:01.519 --> 00:49:03.639
- I'm outta here.
- No, Addi. Don't go.

00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:08.440
Relax. Don't be a downer.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.396
What, you gonna attack me now?

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.680
Take it easy, guys.
You're friends, remember?

00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:19.360
Right. We're friends.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.400
What?

00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:12.639
Mom...

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.836
did you come to me in a dream last night?

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.920
What? What were you doing?

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.475
- Nothing.
- What was he doing?

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:25.639
Nothing.

00:52:27.039 --> 00:52:29.075
Mom comes to my dreams lots of times

00:52:29.159 --> 00:52:31.876
to make sure I don't go to places
I'm not supposed to.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.555
- Yeah, right.
- It's true.

00:52:33.639 --> 00:52:37.796
Your sister's always wandering to places
she's not supposed to, so I go get her.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.960
Places with lots of creepy demons.

00:52:45.239 --> 00:52:48.920
- It's true.
- It's absolutely true.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.356
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I don't believe in that bullshit.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.760
Just leave me alone
and mind your own business.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:27.960
Here.

00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:35.719
The girls told me
some guys are now looking for us.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.220
How do you feel about Balli scoring
last night and not you?

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.760
That wasn't cool last night.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.435
I would understand
if that dude spat on you or me.

00:53:59.519 --> 00:54:03.676
But running into a party for Anna,
without talking to me?

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.599
What if those guys knew how to fight?
We'd been fucking thrashed.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.760
It all worked out.

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:19.880
I just...
I can't deal with the fights anymore.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.440
I don't wanna end up seriously harming
anyone, even if they're an asshole.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.440
Sorry. Friends?

00:54:46.679 --> 00:54:49.400
I mean it. Okay?

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.840
And now kiss.

00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:18.800
Wake up.

00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:33.000
You fainted.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.719
- Have some.
- No.

00:56:00.679 --> 00:56:03.000
Siggi! Siggi!

00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:09.840
I knew it, you idiots. It doesn't work.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.480
What's going on?

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.079
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.075
- Wow, it's so clean.
- You're not gonna trash it up again.

00:56:37.159 --> 00:56:38.199
Calm down.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.910
- What are you doing here?
- I'm allowed to be here.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.236
Did he kick you out?

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.276
No. We're just taking a break.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.360
Balli, don't be so mean to your sister.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.155
So you're Balli's friends?

00:57:00.239 --> 00:57:02.836
Balli can have friends.
He's not completely retarded.

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.079
- Shut up.
- Wow, Balli just started talking back.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.756
What were you doing when I came in?

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.475
Siggi was trying to make drugs
from kiwis and bananas.

00:57:14.559 --> 00:57:15.679
I see.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.119
Well, I'd be careful with that mix.
It can be very dangerous.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.515
How?

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:26.149
I know about people
who've gotten real sick from it.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.320
Sick how?

00:57:31.159 --> 00:57:35.320
They just go crazy for fruit.
Especially bananas.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.356
Siggi once tried
to make drugs from painkillers.

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.916
- No.
- It's true.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
He's lying.

00:58:11.159 --> 00:58:13.679
Hey, guys. Do you see that?

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.519
What?

00:58:24.599 --> 00:58:25.599
What?

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.440
Nothing... Nothing.

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.070
Where did you get that?

00:58:53.599 --> 00:58:56.756
- Did you steal them from my sister?
- You want her to eat mushrooms?

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.876
Of course not. Maybe she was
keeping it for someone else.

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.320
Your sister's a junkie, Balli.
Deal with it.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.599
- No, man, let's drop it.
- Why?

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.199
I've just got a bad feeling about this.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.840
Bad feeling? I knew it.
Addi is going insane.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.555
Hey, hey, Addi, you can rest assured

00:59:25.639 --> 00:59:29.320
that Konni won't be beating up anyone
while he's on mushrooms.

00:59:30.239 --> 00:59:31.920
Come on. Do it with us.

01:02:30.599 --> 01:02:32.756
Jónas has been threatening us.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.155
I wouldn't mind beating up
that fool again.

01:02:35.239 --> 01:02:37.000
But, for you, I'll leave it be.

01:02:38.719 --> 01:02:41.316
So, you guys wanna join Konni
and beat him up?

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.480
No? Then shut the fuck up!

01:02:54.199 --> 01:02:56.559
Here. Is everything okay?

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.320
Don't know.

01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:03.075
I just don't feel too good.

01:03:03.159 --> 01:03:04.796
Doesn't feel too good.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.159
Shut up, idiot.
There's nothing wrong with saying that.

01:03:16.599 --> 01:03:17.800
What's wrong?

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:26.159
I've just got a bad feeling in here.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.356
- Like something bad's about to happen.
- I knew it.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.040
Addi is going crazy in the head.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.079
- Shut up.
- What? I'm allowed to joke about it.

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:51.916
- Fuck.
- Run!

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.920
Which one of you is Konni?

01:03:57.079 --> 01:04:00.079
Are you seriously gonna leave
your fucking friend on his own?

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.800
- Fucking come down here right now.
- Get over here!

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.475
- Fucking rat. I'm gonna kill him.
- His face is turning blue.

01:04:09.559 --> 01:04:11.676
Hey, hey. Easy, easy.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.320
Hey!

01:04:14.199 --> 01:04:16.559
- My car!
- Fucking Konni!

01:04:20.599 --> 01:04:21.840
Can you get up?

01:04:26.159 --> 01:04:27.400
Konni!

01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:49.480
Get the fuck out of my car!
Get the fuck out, now!

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360
Hey!

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.676
They know who those older guys are
that Jónas had with him.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.910
They're gonna help me
make a deal with them.

01:05:39.719 --> 01:05:41.239
What do you want us to do?

01:05:48.199 --> 01:05:51.119
Just wait here and be ready for it,
in case I need help.

01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:32.519
Dude, what are you doing? Put it back.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:35.155
It's Svenni's.

01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:37.515
Leave it. We know it's there.

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:40.519
Don't tell Konni or anyone else about it.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.000
Okay?

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.199
Do you think they might show up here?

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.280
Let's hope not.

01:07:11.159 --> 01:07:14.316
How did you know
they were coming earlier?

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.920
I don't know. Just, here.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.119
Are you psychic?

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:30.356
Hey!

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.960
Were the fuck are you!?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.760
Are you fucking retarded?

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:47.800
Hey, sorry. He told me to do that.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.239
I'm Simon.

01:07:52.119 --> 01:07:53.239
Where's Siggi?

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.760
I promised to give him something.

01:07:58.519 --> 01:08:00.000
Something Siggi's got.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:19.279
Hey, guys.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.800
Have some.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.039
- Have you taken these before?
- Yeah.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:35.235
Then you know not to
take too many to begin with.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:38.359
Just enough to get a little buzz.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Here.

01:08:49.159 --> 01:08:51.235
Look at those guys. I don't trust them.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:54.275
They're gonna sell us, pimp us out.

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:55.800
Balli is on their side!

01:10:32.239 --> 01:10:35.560
Are you okay? Feeling alright?

01:12:11.319 --> 01:12:14.199
Hey, can you open up?
I forgot my jacket in there.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.560
Hey, what are you doing in there?
Open up!

01:12:25.439 --> 01:12:26.476
Hello?

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.960
Shut your face
and piss off or I'll end you.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.600
Get the fuck away from him
or I'll kill you!

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.275
Hey, take it easy, man.

01:13:53.359 --> 01:13:56.840
Let's just forget about this.
It's best for you and your friend too.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.960
Nothing happened.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.395
They were just messing with me.

01:15:00.479 --> 01:15:03.039
I was totally out of it... wasted.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.359
I'll help you get back at them.

01:15:15.039 --> 01:15:19.676
Nothing happened. Nothing happened, okay?

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.000
If you say something else to anyone,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Okay.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:41.600
Pick that up.

01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:12.199
Come here.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.159
Would you look at that.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.039
Come here.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.119
It's good to be home.

01:18:49.279 --> 01:18:50.640
What are you reading?

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.000
Donald Duck?

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.880
Hey, there. Up already?

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.720
Your mom told me
you never got out of bed yesterday.

01:19:04.399 --> 01:19:05.800
What are you doing here?

01:19:06.399 --> 01:19:07.840
Come sit with us.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.720
- Shouldn't you guys just get going?
- Where to?

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.556
- Your dad wants to take you swimming.
- I want to go with.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.516
Elisa, we've talked about this.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.155
Well, don't you wanna give me
some coffee?

01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:24.916
Okay, I'll make one cup of coffee,
but then you'll get going.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.159
Relax, we don't have to leave now.
He just got here.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.516
- And I don't feel like swimming.
- We don't have to go swimming.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.075
We can also just... hang out here,
chat a bit.

01:19:37.159 --> 01:19:42.680
Or grab some food, see a movie,
just do whatever you want.

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:53.079
Your mom said you've been
acting up towards her.

01:19:54.359 --> 01:19:59.119
Punching the wall,
talking back and stuff.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.916
I was just tired.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.680
Just tired?

01:20:06.359 --> 01:20:09.275
"I am so tired!"

01:20:09.359 --> 01:20:12.395
It's no excuse.
I'll kick you out if you do it again.

01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:14.600
This is how you wanted it.

01:20:16.359 --> 01:20:17.359
Hey!

01:20:17.439 --> 01:20:22.115
No, of course.
Seriously, Addi, this isn't okay.

01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:24.955
When I was your age,
I would've been smacked around

01:20:25.039 --> 01:20:27.796
if I even dared to leave
dirty footprints on the floor.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.275
I had to say, "Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.195
How much homework should I do, sir?"

01:20:33.279 --> 01:20:35.159
What's this nonsense?

01:20:36.359 --> 01:20:40.596
- Are you still doing karate?
- No, he stopped showing up to training.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.516
It's because you're
not doing karate anymore.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.275
It makes sense. I'm the same.

01:20:45.359 --> 01:20:48.876
I always need to be moving around,
having something to do.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.039
Maybe I should join you at karate.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.876
- I've stopped drinking, you know.
- For a long time?

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.995
Yes, nearly a month now.

01:20:59.079 --> 01:21:00.596
I feel much better.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.075
Haukur, you smell of beer.

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:05.355
I've stopped drinking spirits.

01:21:05.439 --> 01:21:07.840
Don't you just drink more beer instead?

01:21:10.079 --> 01:21:12.556
Sure, but you know...

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.119
Not really.
I've practically stopped that as well.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.359
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.039
Alright then...

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:21.235
- Don't you want to take the next one?
- The next one?

01:22:21.319 --> 01:22:26.796
It's almost five o'clock.
I'm not sure. I'm supposed to...

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.000
Sure, just go.

01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:31.640
Okay.

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:36.035
- I'll call you.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:38.000
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:39.359 --> 01:22:40.359
Good afternoon.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.716
How long are you planning on staying?

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.399
I don't know.
I'll probably leave tomorrow.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.159
Nonsense. You'll stay here
for as long as you want.

01:23:35.159 --> 01:23:37.559
Finally, the whole family
is back together again.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.319
Dig in. Plenty more where that came from.

01:24:27.399 --> 01:24:30.199
<i>This is Konni.
If you don't know what to do, hang up.</i>

01:24:32.279 --> 01:24:33.279
Addi!

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:42.680
What, are you avoiding me?

01:24:47.399 --> 01:24:48.600
Where's Konni?

01:24:50.359 --> 01:24:53.000
He's just at home. Tired.

01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:56.235
That party was insane the other day.

01:24:56.319 --> 01:24:57.395
What do you mean?

01:24:57.479 --> 01:25:00.315
Just fun. Why? You seem tense.

01:25:00.399 --> 01:25:01.720
Stop it, man.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.199
Calm down.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.560
Another party and we weren't invited!

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.960
What's going on?

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.840
- Svenni's back.
- Hey!

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.960
Who are you?

01:25:34.359 --> 01:25:37.359
- My friends.
- Your friends?

01:25:40.159 --> 01:25:41.909
Aren't you going to invite them in?

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.479
No, they need to get going.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.159
Why doesn't your mom just divorce him?

01:26:18.119 --> 01:26:20.960
She can't. He'd kill her.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.720
She's just hoping that he'll go
back to jail soon.

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:34.560
Don't say anything about this to Konni.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.800
I'm gonna go.

01:26:42.399 --> 01:26:44.796
Why don't you just chill with us
for a bit?

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.359
I just wanna get home.

01:26:59.279 --> 01:27:01.279
Hell yeah, I'm good.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:08.640
Balli, come here. Come on.

01:27:17.279 --> 01:27:20.119
Beer for you, and...

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.479
a beer for your sister.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.235
Tell your sister to come and join us.

01:27:31.319 --> 01:27:34.516
Leave them alone, they don't wanna
hang out with weirdos like us.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.399
Or else we'll come and get her!

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.800
Oh, how annoying.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.199
Addi.

01:29:08.279 --> 01:29:09.779
You can't interfere with this.

01:29:11.399 --> 01:29:13.920
Some things aren't ours to influence.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.079
Hey, Balli.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.079
Dude.

01:31:17.399 --> 01:31:18.649
Does he beat up your mom?

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.840
Is he doing something he shouldn't,
to you or your sister?

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.199
Like what?

01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:45.439
Has he raped her?

01:32:11.319 --> 01:32:12.600
I'm going to kill him.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.680
We have to get him out of there.

01:32:39.439 --> 01:32:40.589
We could call the cops.

01:32:41.399 --> 01:32:44.399
Don't you think they'd done that
long ago if they dared too?

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.239
Balli can do it.

01:32:51.079 --> 01:32:52.960
What do you think he'll do to Balli?

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.315
This is what we'll do:
We'll take masks and clubs

01:32:57.399 --> 01:33:00.596
and tell him if he doesn't fuck off,
we'll smash his head in.

01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.836
- He'll kill you.
- He can't handle all of us.

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.359
No way am I doing that.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.716
You're not gonna stand by your friend?

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.000
- Balli doesn't want us to do anything.
- No?

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:17.556
He just wants that creep to keep on
raping his sister and beating up his mom.

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.359
Let's get Simon and his friends to do it.
They're more likely to scare him.

01:33:24.439 --> 01:33:29.359
Relax. Let go of him.
Konni, let go of him.

01:33:30.159 --> 01:33:33.359
What about you? Are you too good for me?

01:33:34.159 --> 01:33:35.760
Too good for Balli?

01:33:36.479 --> 01:33:38.399
Are you a pussy now, like Siggi?

01:33:41.319 --> 01:33:44.955
I swear, if you're not with us,
you'll regret it.

01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:46.640
We're doing this.

01:33:55.159 --> 01:33:58.800
Balli. When is he home alone?

01:34:24.279 --> 01:34:25.760
Abba, come on.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.916
Get the fuck away from here
and never come back

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.676
or we'll kill you! Understand?

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.319
Take it easy. Just take it easy.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.840
We're leaving. Let him go!

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.600
I said let go of him!

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.275
Addi. What happened?

01:38:44.359 --> 01:38:47.479
I'm just taking a bath. Leave me alone.

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:37.399
Good morning. Arnar Hauksson?

01:39:40.279 --> 01:39:42.279
He needs to come with us.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.355
Sooner or later your friends are going
to tell us what happened.

01:40:08.439 --> 01:40:12.840
It's important for us to get your version
of the story now.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.916
Otherwise you might end up
taking the blame

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.760
for something you didn't do.

01:40:19.159 --> 01:40:22.075
You don't have a record here with us,

01:40:22.159 --> 01:40:26.876
but Konrad Fridriksson has a long record,

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.880
and it seems like he went too far
this time.

01:40:32.279 --> 01:40:35.199
Because the man you attacked...

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:40.199
will most likely not survive.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.399
You do realize the gravity
of what has happened?

01:40:52.039 --> 01:40:53.319
Don't you?

01:42:40.159 --> 01:42:41.359
Listen to me.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.439
You have to tell the police
what happened.

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.000
You can't be thinking
of your friends now.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.319
It's best for everyone, including them,
that you tell the truth.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.920
I was the one who hit him.

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:26.840
Don't say anything.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.000
Not a word.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.760
Let me figure this out.

01:43:45.199 --> 01:43:46.600
I don't know.

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.360
Were they looking for something?

01:43:52.279 --> 01:43:55.920
Did your stepfather have anything
that they wanted?

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.239
Baldur.

01:44:10.039 --> 01:44:14.119
We know it hasn't always been easy
living with your stepfather.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.680
What happened that made your friends
attack him?

01:44:51.399 --> 01:44:52.720
Let's go home.

01:45:08.279 --> 01:45:10.239
- What did your friend do?
- Elisa.

01:45:11.359 --> 01:45:13.596
Your brother doesn't want
to talk about it.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.995
Did you see it?

01:45:15.079 --> 01:45:18.179
What's wrong with you?
I said we're not going to talk about it.

01:45:19.039 --> 01:45:20.640
Just leave your brother alone.

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:14.119
Balli just said it was self-defense.

01:46:15.279 --> 01:46:19.119
He also told the cops what the old man
was doing to his mom and sister.

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.319
And if he isn't a vegetable,
he's going back to prison.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:32.920
What about Balli?

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.279
I'm gonna head home.

01:47:10.279 --> 01:47:12.229
Siggi thinks I was the one who hit him.

01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.960
I'm gonna fuck off too. See ya.

01:48:02.279 --> 01:48:05.319
Imagine that a bright light surrounds you

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.520
and protects you.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.560
Mom.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.079
Do you know where Balli is?

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.840
Please...

01:48:39.359 --> 01:48:41.359
I just want to know how he's doing.

01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:58.920
Looking good.

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.039
Thanks.

01:49:09.359 --> 01:49:10.479
How are you?

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.159
I'm alright.
Just can't wait to go back home.

01:49:21.079 --> 01:49:22.520
How's your mom?

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.955
She knew it wasn't me.
But still didn't say anything.

01:49:29.039 --> 01:49:31.239
I haven't seen her since I moved.

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.916
She never comes over
when she's allowed to.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.119
I just hope she's not drugged up
and totally out of it.

01:49:39.079 --> 01:49:41.235
I saw her in the neighborhood
the other day.

01:49:41.319 --> 01:49:42.920
She looked okay.

01:50:11.279 --> 01:50:12.399
I'm sorry.

01:50:17.159 --> 01:50:19.476
It's okay,
you don't have to say sorry to me.

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.960
He deserved it.

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.190
What's up with Siggi and Konni?

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.075
I don't know.

01:50:34.159 --> 01:50:38.319
Siggi never leaves the house anymore,
spends all his time on his computer.

01:50:39.119 --> 01:50:43.600
Konni started hanging out with some
guys I don't want to hang out with.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.119
Do you still sense things?

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:49.199
Sometimes.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:53.760
Can you read my fortune?

01:50:55.239 --> 01:50:56.920
No, man. I can't do that.

01:51:00.399 --> 01:51:01.600
Just try it.

01:51:20.279 --> 01:51:21.640
What?

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.680
You will...

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:27.836
turn yourself into a woman.

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:30.955
- Shut up, man.
- It's true. I'm being serious.

01:51:31.039 --> 01:51:34.680
You and Siggi are gonna be a couple,
and have sex all the time.

01:51:35.359 --> 01:51:40.035
Siggi will be all fat and bald,
in bed, with his dog, calling for you.

01:51:40.119 --> 01:51:41.995
- "Ballína!"
- Shut up, man. That's gross.

01:51:42.079 --> 01:51:43.796
"Do you want to have a threesome?"

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:47.399
- You'd like that, disgusting.
- Shut up.

01:51:58.119 --> 01:52:02.880
But seriously,
I think you're going to be fine.

01:52:10.199 --> 01:52:12.199
Thanks for being my friend.
