3
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,239
Hello?

4
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,006
Hello?

5
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:21,907
Hey.

6
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:26,316
- Stay away
from me! Stay away from me!

7
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,261
How many
of you can hear me?

8
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,865
Why is everyone quiet
all of a sudden?

9
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,466
How many of you are there?

10
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,163
I'm here.

11
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:46,303
I'm here.

12
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,335
Look, I'm not
here to hurt anyone, okay?

13
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,371
Okay, I just woke up here.

14
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:53,772
I don't know what's going on.

15
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,273
I'm just trying to
figure this out, okay?

16
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,710
Okay.

17
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:00,350
I don't know where I am either.

18
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,984
What's the last
thing you remember?

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,619
I don't know.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,259
My head hurts.

21
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:11,592
Me too, just try to remember.

22
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:15,629
I was home.

23
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,569
Then the last thing I remember.

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,902
I'm freezing.

25
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:29,610
It's okay.

26
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,850
I'm wearing a jacket.

27
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:34,978
I'll give it to you.

28
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,816
Follow the sound
of my voice, okay?

29
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,621
Okay.

30
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,729
Can you walk?

31
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,223
I'm coming toward you.

32
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,258
- I can't see

33
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,200
Okay, I'm coming to you.

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,871
Sorry.

35
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,035
That's my hand.

36
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,736
Sorry.

37
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:59,640
At least I found you.
There's two of us.

38
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,645
I'm giving you my
jacket, put it on.

39
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,624
I heard at least two
other voices before.

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,391
Where are you?

41
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,361
Hello?
- Please don't leave me.

42
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,195
Where are
you, say something.

43
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:22,428
Anyone remember anything?

44
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,463
Anyone see a light or anything?

45
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,470
I just woke up here in darkness.

46
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:30,402
Just keep talking
so I can find you.

47
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:31,435
Don't leave me.

48
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,607
I'm scared, please.

49
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,732
- What the hell?

50
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,574
- Where are we?

51
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,520
Can anyone hear me?

52
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:55,657
- Whoa.

53
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:19,879
- Hey, give me that.

54
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:25,082
- And why would I
want to do that?

55
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,790
Fine, take it.

56
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:52,978
What's wrong with him?

57
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,389
- I don't know, maybe
something they drugged us with.

58
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,127
You're okay.

59
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:10,094
What?

60
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:12,598
Just calm down.

61
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:13,631
We all just woke up here too.

62
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,099
We're not gonna hurt you.

63
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,580
- Stay back.
- Just take it easy, man.

64
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:39,695
- Hey!

65
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,732
Let me out of here!

66
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,876
- Hey, are you okay?

67
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:01,948
Are you pregnant?

68
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:04,016
- Yeah.

69
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,198
- I already tried that.

70
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,897
- Hey, she's fucking pregnant.

71
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,638
- Someone give her their weapon.

72
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,207
Give her your machete.

73
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:27,875
- Wait a minute.

74
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,912
Give that pregnant
lady your machete.

75
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:34,211
Why?

76
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:39,216
Because a girl with
a gun told you to.

77
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:44,522
Give it to her, I'm not
going to say it again.

78
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,597
- Okay, okay.

79
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,161
I'm not the enemy here.

80
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:53,934
Thank you.

81
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:58,972
Just everybody watch where
they point those things.

82
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:01,942
- Come on.

83
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:05,748
Hey, somebody
let me out of here!

84
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:11,319
- Please, please stop, please.

85
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,954
- Hey man, knock it off!

86
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,861
- Just calm down.

87
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:27,638
- Hey!

88
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:30,908
Man, knock it off! Why
don't you come over here?

89
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:56,634
- I see.

90
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,904
You found the tools.

91
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,067
Good.

92
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,242
But tools are nothing

93
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,703
until you learn how to use them.

94
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,671
- Where are we?

95
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,008
Why are we here?

96
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,143
To find out who we
really are, Sean.

97
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:13,613
Wait, how do you know my name?

98
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,818
- I know a lot about you.

99
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:19,822
And I want to know
more about all of you.

100
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,828
- Oh god, this is
too fucking crazy.

101
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,891
I gotta get out of here,
gotta get fucking out of here.

102
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:29,695
Somebody let me out of here!

103
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,296
- Richard, pay attention.

104
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,337
I am going to tell you
how you can get out.

105
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:38,341
Okay, I'm listening.

106
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:41,575
My name is Dr. Kasuma,

107
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,276
and this is my experiment.

108
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:48,918
On this screen, you will
see a person who is trapped.

109
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,020
You can free that person
very easily and yourself.

110
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:57,123
All you have to do is
kill someone in this room.

111
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,260
- That's crazy.

112
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:04,361
- Tracey, what is your maternal
instinct telling you to do?

113
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:06,803
My instinct is telling
me that you're sick

114
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,139
and I don't want to
play your little game.

115
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,103
That's fine.

116
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:16,615
But I guarantee someone
else will play eventually.

117
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:24,384
None of us are gonna decide
to kill someone in this room.

118
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,723
- No?

119
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,154
You are all strangers.

120
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:32,461
But this woman, she
is someone one of you

121
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,964
will miss very, very much.

122
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:40,397
- Sarah, Sarah.

123
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,843
She is safe for now,
but not for long.

124
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,344
Are you willing to do what
it takes to free your wife

125
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,109
and yourself, Richard?

126
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,677
Olivia, you have
tools in your hand.

127
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:58,019
You can free yourself and you
can leave anytime you want.

128
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:01,519
Please, I don't want to
be here anymore, please!

129
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:06,061
- No, no, no, no, Olivia,
begging does you no good.

130
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:10,326
First person to kill
someone here leaves.

131
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,535
By killing first, you'll
save your own life

132
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,432
and that of someone else.

133
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,139
You can walk right out the door

134
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,507
but you have to
earn that privilege.

135
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,148
Alice, I see you found
a very powerful tool.

136
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,955
I hope you use it wisely.

137
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,691
You have until the
timer goes off to

138
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:46,166
decide if this woman lives or
dies, save her and yourself.

139
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,036
- Sarah, talk to
me, where are you?

140
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,038
Can you hear my voice?

141
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,476
Kill someone and we live.

142
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:58,881
Why?

143
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,385
I mean, how can we
even believe her?

144
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,850
- You will believe me, L,

145
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,350
because you have
no other choice.

146
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,451
When the timer runs out

147
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:11,862
the lights will go out
and one of you must die.

148
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,777
- Just calm down, man.

149
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,144
You're not making any sense.

150
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,377
Just relax and calm down
while we try to think.

151
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,584
- You just want me
to fucking relax?

152
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,986
You want me to relax?

153
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,752
They have my wife's
somewhere in a cell,

154
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,924
and you want me to relax?

155
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,128
- Oh God, Sarah.

156
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:53,864
Your wife is okay, Richard.

157
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,433
My wife is okay.

158
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,237
Oh, is she?

159
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,408
She's okay?

160
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:00,740
All good.

161
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,641
Good, that's good.

162
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:02,776
That's good.

163
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:03,907
You think she's okay?

164
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,080
Fuck you!

165
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,954
- Do you recognize that
woman in the screen?

166
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,022
I've never seen that woman.

167
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,496
- I think she's trying to say is

168
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,024
are you in on this whole thing?

169
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,393
What do you know?

170
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:24,132
Are you part of that
lady's experiment?

171
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,036
I've never seen that woman.

172
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,468
- Look, you two look
an awful lot alike.

173
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,876
Am I suppose to think that's
a fucking coincidence?

174
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,775
- It's not that much
of a coincidence.

175
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:36,210
there is a whole fucking,

176
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:37,949
- That's too much of
a coincidence for me!

177
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,011
- Look, Olivia is in here
with all of us, okay?

178
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:42,084
How could she be in on it?

179
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,349
Something's not right
about her being here.

180
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:47,355
- Nothing is right
about any of this.

181
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,028
We have to try to get out of
here any way that we can, okay?

182
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,696
Let's try prying the door
open with your hatchet.

183
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,867
- Richard, we could use your ax.

184
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,536
Richard, please, come on.

185
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,333
- Stay the fuck away from me.

186
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,085
You should cover your
ears in there little one.

187
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:21,893
I'm gonna get you out of here.

188
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,228
- Can you hear me, anything?

189
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:37,068
- Gimme that gun, we
gotta shoot the lock off!

190
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:38,738
No way, this gun is mine.

191
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:40,405
Get your own.

192
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,146
- I'm not playing, give
me that fucking gun.

193
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,650
- Fuck you.

194
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,186
What part of gun beats knife

195
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,387
and every other weapon in this
room don't you understand?

196
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,221
- Come on, you don't have
to take the gun from her.

197
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:56,888
She can shoot the
lock off herself.

198
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,121
Alice, right?

199
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:00,461
Look, I'm unarmed.

200
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:04,761
If we can get this door open,
we can all get out alive.

201
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:08,371
Why do you keep acting
like you know everything?

202
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,141
We have no idea what's on
the other side of that door.

203
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:15,407
The only thing I know
for certain right now is

204
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:20,380
if I keep this gun,
I'm going to live.

205
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,988
I'm tired of your shit.

206
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,293
Do not make me take
that gun from you.

207
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,454
Go ahead.

208
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:31,963
You'll take a bullet
to the face too.

209
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:45,136
We don't have much time left.

210
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:46,136
What are you gonna do?

211
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:47,979
What is he going to do?

212
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,042
I'm not gonna do anything.

213
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:53,584
I'm not..

214
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,415
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

215
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,420
I bet you'd think different
if you had the gun.

216
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:04,191
Gun, ax, hatchet, I'm
not a fucking killer.

217
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,257
None of us deserve
to die right now

218
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,731
this is all just ridiculous.

219
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:11,435
Even to save her life?

220
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,696
Fucking pussy.

221
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:17,437
You
don't fucking know me.

222
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,079
Stay back!

223
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:25,683
- You don't know me.

224
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,045
None of you fucking know me.

225
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:29,278
None of you know me!

226
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:45,730
So you'd rather kill any
of us? Murder is that easy?

227
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:48,667
Hey, this is all still
just hypothetical, right?

228
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:51,141
- Till the timer runs out
and the lights go out...

229
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,245
- This all could
be a game, right?

230
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:59,277
I mean, she keeps calling
this an experiment

231
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:02,285
like it's a psychological test.

232
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,722
I mean, there's no way that
she expects any one of us

233
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,951
to kill somebody in this room.

234
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,321
This is real.

235
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,621
There's nothing
hypothetical about it.

236
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,530
- Hey, are you okay?

237
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,798
- Yeah, please just
stay away from me.

238
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,581
- What do you expect
me to do then, huh?

239
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,713
What do you want me to do?

240
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,450
Hack one of these
people to death

241
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,660
In order for my wife to live?

242
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,387
Is that what you want?

243
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,789
What do you want from me?

244
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,192
Let me talk to my wife.

245
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,963
Let me talk to my wife.

246
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,202
Let me talk to my wife!

247
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,372
Richard?

248
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:02,608
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,
can you hear me?

249
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,587
Who's there with you?

250
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:11,551
Are you alone?

251
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,722
Are they feeding you?

252
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,392
Where are you?

253
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,299
I'm real close.

254
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:29,305
I know things haven't
been good in a long time

255
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,408
and I'm sorry, I know
I pushed you away,

256
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:37,579
and I just, if you
can get me out of here

257
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:42,718
I'll be so much better,
I'm sorry for everything.

258
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,583
I'm so sorry.

259
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:48,023
- Just don't worry,
okay, just relax.

260
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:49,123
We're gonna get you out of there

261
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,289
and then we're gonna go home.

262
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,597
- Okay, I can't wait.

263
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:59,203
Oh God, Richard, I love you.

264
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:11,211
Let me talk to my wife.

265
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,217
Let me fucking talk to my wife!

266
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,648
Let me talk to my wife!

267
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,257
If my wife dies, I'm not a
killer, I didn't do this,

268
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,887
I'm not, this isn't
me, I didn't kill her.

269
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:25,625
It's that fucked up woman
on TV, she's the killer.

270
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,423
She's the one that's
doing this, not me.

271
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:29,965
I didn't do this.

272
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,428
Somebody do something.

273
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:33,765
Stop the fucking ticking!

274
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:39,176
Somebody let me out
of here, please!

275
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,611
Somebody please
help me out of here!

276
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:43,841
No!

277
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:41,232
- Was that you screaming?

278
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:42,940
Are you alright?

279
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,868
Yeah, I didn't mean to scream.

280
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:48,572
I thought he was
coming toward me.

281
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:52,377
- I didn't do it, are you happy?

282
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:53,977
Did you get your results?

283
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,881
Good, write them down.

284
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:00,485
Your experiment worked.

285
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,490
I'm not a killer, you got that?

286
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,857
Now open the door
and let us out.

287
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:10,662
Richard, you love your wife.

288
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,470
And she obviously loves
you very much too.

289
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,505
But you didn't love her
enough to save her, did you?

290
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:20,338
You know the
consequences of inaction.

291
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:22,742
But seeing is believing.

292
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:28,653
Richard, Richard,
please help me.

293
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:33,482
No, no, no, Sarah,
Sarah, Sarah, no.

294
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:34,754
What is that?

295
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,456
- Richard, please help me!

296
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:39,158
Richard, where are you, help me!

297
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,233
Richard, I can't breathe.

298
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,903
Sarah, focus.

299
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,638
Sarah, focus, there's gotta
be a way out of there, okay?

300
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,269
There's gotta be a
way out of there,

301
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:55,539
just look around, look around,
pound the walls, scream.

302
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,078
Is there a window, a door?

303
00:21:58,213 --> 00:21:59,280
Look over there.

304
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,352
Look, look, look, behind you.

305
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:05,356
- Hello, Richard, help me.

306
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,990
Oh God, Sarah, I'm sorry.

307
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,195
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

308
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,526
I'm sorry, Richard,

309
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,763
but I don't like the
results of this experiment.

310
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,830
But tell me, why didn't you
do anything to save your wife?

311
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:31,805
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

312
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,547
- They say you don't know
what you have until it's gone.

313
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,281
Do you know what you
had now, Richard?

314
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,218
- Okay, that's enough.

315
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,950
Richard, your wife isn't dead.

316
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:46,787
This is just another
part of their experiment.

317
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:49,125
And they just gassed her
the same way they did us

318
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,554
when they brought us here

319
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:52,792
Your wife is fine.

320
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:56,832
- No Sean, his wife
is indeed dead.

321
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,670
I can provide more graphic
proof if you don't believe me.

322
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,132
- That's enough, stop torturing
us and let us out of here.

323
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:06,170
- This isn't torture,
this is a test.

324
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:09,177
Would you like me to show
you the difference, L?

325
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:10,278
- This isn't a test.

326
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,680
This is sadism, you freak.

327
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:16,585
Please, please, just
let us go, please.

328
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,719
There's one way out
of here for you.

329
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:22,889
Follow the rules
of the experiment.

330
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:38,204
- Crazy bitch has my sister!

331
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,738
- Whoa, whoa, calm down, watch
where you point that thing.

332
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:44,680
Why, I might kill someone?

333
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:48,884
Have you fuckers been
paying attention?

334
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,824
They're going to kill my sister
if I don't kill one of you.

335
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,861
The only question now is which
one of you deserves to die?

336
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,058
You?

337
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:01,864
Don't you point that
fucking thing at me.

338
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,962
You?

339
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,096
You?

340
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,969
Or him?

341
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:14,203
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

342
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:17,046
We don't know if anybody
is actually dead yet.

343
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:17,873
- You're right.

344
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,782
That's actually possible.

345
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,351
The gas, maybe they just knocked
her out for a little while

346
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,083
the same way they did us.

347
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,988
No, she's gone.

348
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:31,859
She's gone.

349
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:36,066
I saw her face.

350
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,531
Oh, it's my fault.

351
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,737
No, it's not your fault.

352
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:44,674
She knew that you loved her

353
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:47,770
and you were there
for her when she died.

354
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:49,239
What does it matter?

355
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,182
We're not growing old together.

356
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,815
We're not having a family.

357
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:59,581
She's dead. Period.

358
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:01,552
The end.

359
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,022
That's it.

360
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,793
You stay away from me.

361
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,196
Just leave me alone, okay?

362
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,634
- Just put it away, there
has to be another solution.

363
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,270
- Look at him.

364
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:22,878
Ask him and his wife if
there's another solution.

365
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:25,376
- Alice, put the gun
down, you're not a killer.

366
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:26,512
I'm not.

367
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:27,948
No! You're not a killer!

368
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,851
Fuck you, you don't
know anything about me

369
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:34,283
and I don't know
anything about you.

370
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,622
Why would I choose
any of your lives

371
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:39,263
over the life of my sister?

372
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,193
Just hold on a second, okay?

373
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,833
Look, you've got a gun and
there's still time left.

374
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,201
Let's just take a second
and talk things out, okay?

375
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:48,071
- Fine, talk!

376
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,135
Just stay back.

377
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:55,810
Okay, so what?

378
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:59,608
- What, I'm supposed to
have all the answers?

379
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,114
I just want us to talk before
things get out of control.

380
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:06,488
- Things are already
out of control.

381
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:10,054
Alright, so what do we know?

382
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,761
That lady can see
us and hear us.

383
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:17,063
So any escape attempt
that we might try to do.

384
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,502
- Look, there's no
way they could get us

385
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:23,037
in this room by themself.

386
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:26,270
There's gotta be more
people outside that door.

387
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,653
I can't hear anything.

388
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,823
I can't hear anyone out here.

389
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,128
She knows.

390
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:52,000
Me?

391
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:56,135
Tell us, how many of your
friends are out there?

392
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,676
- I already told you,

393
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,410
I was forced into
this room same as you,

394
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,873
I have nothing to do with this.

395
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,206
- Maybe you do, maybe you don't,

396
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:06,145
I know the fastest
way to find out.

397
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:08,478
Stop it, alright,

398
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:11,780
we have to work together if
we want to get out of here.

399
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:17,123
- Wait, wait, if they had his
wife and they have your sister

400
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:19,660
it makes sense that
they have someone

401
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,226
that each of us cares about.

402
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,027
- Tracey's right.

403
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,396
They got us and our loved ones.

404
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:34,042
So, so where, where are
they keeping them, huh?

405
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,371
Here?

406
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,412
In the same building
or somewhere else?

407
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:39,650
Just no way of knowing.

408
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,648
- We don't even know
where we are right now.

409
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:43,316
What does it all mean?

410
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:45,420
I mean, what does that doctor
lady, what does she want?

411
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:46,856
You know what she wants,

412
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,788
she wants me to kill
someone in this room!

413
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,957
- And if this is an experiment,

414
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:53,863
there has to be
a way to beat it.

415
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,499
- They tell us that they
want us to kill someone

416
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,931
but that can't be the answer.

417
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,865
They must be looking
for something.

418
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:01,430
What are they trying to find?

419
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:03,201
- They want to see
us act like animals!

420
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:07,778
They're using people we
love to manipulate us.

421
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,043
If I kill one person, I
get out of here alive.

422
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,985
My sister gets out too,

423
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:19,184
now that sounds like a
way better deal to me

424
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,490
than dying in here with
a bunch of strangers.

425
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:25,054
Hey, just wait a minute.

426
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:27,093
This isn't about love.

427
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:30,631
That doctor lady, she's
playing us like rats.

428
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:33,099
She wants to see us fight.

429
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:38,307
Yeah, and I'm about
to end this game.

430
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:50,083
Should have killed one of you,

431
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,284
I could've been
with her right now.

432
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,989
You couldn't kill for your wife.

433
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,726
That doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

434
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,129
- No, it just means I'm weak.

435
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:06,463
Come on, go ahead, go
ahead, shoot me, come on.

436
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,747
Stay back.
- Go on, shoot me.

437
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,881
Come on, come on, do it.
- Stay back.

438
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:25,850
Shoot me, I'm volunteering.

439
00:30:25,985 --> 00:30:27,858
Save your sister.

440
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:36,060
Save your sister, save yourself.

441
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:37,933
Get out of here and end this.

442
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:40,233
- Richard, you don't
mean that, don't do it.

443
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:49,143
You don't have to do this.

444
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:56,213
Do you want to see her
dead in front of you?

445
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:59,314
Just do it.
- Don't do it.

446
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,553
- Do it.
- Don't do it.

447
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,291
- Hurry!

448
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:04,527
- Do it.

449
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,062
Let him go, Alice. -Stop!

450
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:10,661
Just do it, shoot,
shoot, come on.

451
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:12,762
Do it, come on, do it, I'm
volunteering, just shoot me.

452
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:18,271
Do it, come on, do it, I'm
volunteering, just shoot me.

453
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:25,476
Natalie?

454
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:39,358
Come on, pull the
fucking trigger.

455
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:50,105
Do it, do it now.

456
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,103
Come on, you can do it.

457
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:54,637
Pull the motherfucking trigger.

458
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,740
Are you fucking kidding me?!

459
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:50,232
- Look at you now.

460
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:53,234
You don't have shit,
just like the rest of us.

461
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,566
You're stuck here.

462
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,438
And your sister's gonna die.

463
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,421
Fucking die!

464
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:39,643
- No, no, help me, help me!

465
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:45,081
I don't wanna die,
please help me!

466
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,749
Please help me.

467
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:56,792
- You stabbed her!

468
00:33:56,928 --> 00:34:00,433
No, no, I just took the
machete, I needed a weapon!

469
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:02,699
You did this.

470
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,939
- I didn't do it, he did it.

471
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:07,677
- I didn't touch her!

472
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:10,345
Then why are you bleeding?

473
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,811
- You tell me, I wasn't
the one that touched her.

474
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:21,090
- Come on guys, help her!

475
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,759
Alice, please, you
have to save her.

476
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,524
You have to save my baby.

477
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:28,031
Please help me.

478
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,529
- Alice, you better
fucking help her.

479
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:34,267
Please, anybody help me.

480
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:37,806
- We can't, it's either
her or my sister,

481
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,236
I can't, she's gotta die.

482
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,903
Get away from her!

483
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,881
Alice, I know
you're a good person

484
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,348
and I don't blame you for this.

485
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:50,179
I don't blame you, but your
sister's gonna be fine.

486
00:34:50,314 --> 00:34:51,380
But my baby.

487
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:54,053
Tracey, your baby is dead!

488
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:56,659
- No, no, no, not yet.

489
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,892
No, just help me.

490
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:01,727
Please just help me!

491
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:06,296
- Please, she needs a doctor,
she's fucking pregnant!

492
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:08,666
Come on, have some decency!

493
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:14,270
Alice, I trust you, I trust you.

494
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,173
I need you to save her.

495
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:24,381
What's her name?

496
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:26,548
- I don't know, we were waiting

497
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:29,491
until she was born to name her.

498
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,194
But, um

499
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,460
um maybe Rose.

500
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:46,538
Help her.

501
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:51,313
Alice, Alice, you
can't let her die.

502
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:57,253
You can do anything
what you want.

503
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,554
Wait

504
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:06,229
- Okay, okay, what can I do?

505
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:11,632
- You need the smallest,
sharpest weapon in here.

506
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:16,873
- Where's the knife, where's
the knife, give it to me.

507
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,000
Shit, you just had it.

508
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:23,109
- Then do it for her!
- Give her your knife.

509
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,644
Just give it to her, man.

510
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:31,188
- Give her your fucking knife!

511
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:40,659
Now what?

512
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,633
- Okay, okay, you're going to
have to listen to me because

513
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,339
once you start, I'm not
going be able to help you.

514
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:54,910
You're going to have
to cut horizontally

515
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,411
across my pelvis and then

516
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,612
you're gonna to have
to pull her out.

517
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,946
How will I know where to cut?

518
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:09,721
- I have a scar from my son.

519
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:15,562
I'm gonna do it, okay?
- Okay, okay.

520
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:30,309
- I'll take care of her, okay?

521
00:37:30,444 --> 00:37:31,881
I'm gonna make sure she's okay!

522
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,776
No one's gonna touch her.

523
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:35,549
- Okay, I trust
you, I trust you.

524
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,717
- I'm gonna reach in to
get the baby out, okay?

525
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:43,722
Is she okay?

526
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:45,856
- She's fine.

527
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:51,730
Hold your baby girl.

528
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:30,137
So we fix our eyes
not on what is seen,

529
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:33,339
but on what is unseen,

530
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:36,738
for what is seen is temporary,

531
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,647
but what is unseen is eternal

532
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,602
That was a
nice effort, Alice.

533
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:04,632
Too bad, you couldn't
save Tracey's baby

534
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:07,038
or your poor sister.

535
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,004
- What?

536
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:12,811
The kill needs to happen
before the lights come on.

537
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:15,511
I didn't do this,
but she's dead.

538
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,052
That's not right.

539
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,422
This is all an experiment.

540
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,755
There's no right or
wrong here, Alice.

541
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,895
I only want to learn
from the best result.

542
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,622
Alice, can you hear me?

543
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,663
Please, I'm scared.

544
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:39,607
Alice, come and get
me out of here, Alice.

545
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:43,972
You're still gonna kill
her sister after all this?

546
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:46,544
By failing to
follow instructions,

547
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,814
all of you killed her sister.

548
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:50,849
You're a monster.

549
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:57,123
You are the monster,
Sean. Don't you see?

550
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:58,426
You all are.

551
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,727
My experiment is
only proving that.

552
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,698
And the result from
this experiment

553
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,733
will change the way we
all think about humanity,

554
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:12,068
morality, life, love
and of course, death.

555
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:16,479
You can't turn me
into a murderer.

556
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:22,217
She's dead, please, she's gone.

557
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:23,745
Please just spare my sister.

558
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,483
You gave me fucking blanks.

559
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,388
I'm trying to kill!

560
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,027
Your excuses are
unacceptable, Alice.

561
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:42,839
Natalie, can you hear me?

562
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:49,672
I can't help you.

563
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:52,013
I can't help either of us.

564
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,516
I'm so sorry.

565
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,487
You know me, I can't
do anything right.

566
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:03,525
- It's okay, Allie,
I know you're good.

567
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,926
I know you've been
looking out for me.

568
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:09,026
You've always been so
much stronger than me.

569
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:16,935
- I'm not strong, I was selfish.

570
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,202
I've always been selfish.

571
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,743
I'm sorry I wasn't a
better sister to you.

572
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:28,177
I'm sorry I stole
everything from you.

573
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,787
I stole your boyfriends,
your money, everything.

574
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,593
I tried to save you.

575
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:40,189
I really did.

576
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,195
- I'm just tired.

577
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:49,968
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

578
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,241
No, Natalie, don't go to sleep.

579
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,139
Natalie, can you hear me?

580
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,120
You evil bitch!

581
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:13,189
You're going to kill
all of us, aren't you?

582
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,998
I'm not the one making
the choices here, you are.

583
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:34,410
- Do you think it stopped?

584
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:37,246
Do you think that
means that she's seen enough?

585
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,788
A person like that
never sees enough.

586
00:42:41,957 --> 00:42:44,594
- Maybe she wants to
see what happens next.

587
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,796
How we deal with this trauma.

588
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,831
- There's no way we're all
getting out of here alive.

589
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:57,036
- This is an experiment, right?

590
00:42:58,006 --> 00:42:59,937
Maybe she got the
results she wanted.

591
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:04,242
I mean, they saw
Richard not do anything.

592
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:08,211
They made Alice attempt to
kill and Tracey getting hurt.

593
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,851
It was just an accident.

594
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:18,254
She knows I didn't do anything.

595
00:43:19,356 --> 00:43:21,895
She just wanted to
see my wife die.

596
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:29,166
She would do
anything for anybody.

597
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:32,939
I can still see her face
just coming towards me.

598
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:36,074
It's just happening over
and over and over again.

599
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,914
It's like I'm fucking
living in hell.

600
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:43,784
I was ready to shoot that
poor man in the face.

601
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,624
- Come on, let us out,
haven't you seen enough!

602
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,858
- The doors aren't opening,
nothing's happening.

603
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:55,595
- That door isn't going to open.

604
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:57,728
Then what's this waiting for?

605
00:43:57,863 --> 00:43:59,196
- The bitch is crazy.

606
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,896
Maybe she just wants to
see us all kill each other.

607
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:03,805
- Look the TV's off.

608
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:05,972
There's no ticking.

609
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:09,173
Maybe she's thinking it over.

610
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:13,274
- You think she's
planning on letting us go?

611
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,377
We should come up
with a plan too.

612
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,616
Hey, stay back we're
not out of anything!

613
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:20,690
Okay, okay, no problem.

614
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,125
Please, open the door!

615
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:31,360
- The door, open it?

616
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,002
You think they're
gonna open that door?

617
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:37,465
They're never gonna
open that door.

618
00:44:38,402 --> 00:44:40,739
They are never
opening that door,

619
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,811
we're all gonna die in here.

620
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,979
We're all gonna die
and rot in this room.

621
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,854
Open the door!

622
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,156
I don't wanna die
in here, please!

623
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:00,956
I just wanna go back home alive.

624
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:02,662
We just wanna go back home.

625
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:04,529
We don't care what you want.

626
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:05,930
We don't care!

627
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:08,203
Please let us go
back home alive!

628
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,666
- Come on!

629
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:10,905
Let us out!

630
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:18,407
The experiment isn't over yet.

631
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:22,180
It is absolutely essential
that you continue.

632
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:31,688
- Who is that?

633
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:32,894
Who knows her?

634
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,627
I know her.

635
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:38,064
She's my girlfriend.

636
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,265
Ana, can you hear me?

637
00:45:42,635 --> 00:45:43,465
Ana?

638
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:51,111
Ana, Ana, hey, hey,
can you hear me?

639
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:54,509
Look, look, I'm
here, I'm here, Ana.

640
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:58,282
- Hurry, help, I love you.

641
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,626
I don't know how
I got here, baby.

642
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,324
I don't know what's happening.

643
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:11,693
Baby, just be patient,
okay, just be patient.

644
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:16,205
I will get you out, okay, I
promise, I promise to you, okay?

645
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,499
- I love you.

646
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,504
I love you too.

647
00:47:53,763 --> 00:47:56,268
I don't want to have
to kill you, Richard.

648
00:47:58,236 --> 00:47:59,601
But I'm going to have to.

649
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,978
- I know, I know, I know.

650
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:06,344
I understand.

651
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,380
I'm done, done playing.

652
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:12,053
Just do it.

653
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:15,518
- I think you have to
make it easy for me.

654
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:24,164
I think you should
kill yourself.

655
00:48:27,463 --> 00:48:28,936
You allowed your wife to die

656
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,204
because you couldn't
kill for her.

657
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:34,108
Now it's time.

658
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,918
This is really sharp.

659
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:49,992
You can slit your wrist
with it very easily.

660
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:57,164
Let me show you.

661
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,341
Slice your wrist down
your arm like this.

662
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:06,404
Not across.

663
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,979
You will bleed out
really quickly.

664
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,642
It will barely hurt.

665
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:21,456
- Seriously, you're
gonna let this happen?

666
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,953
- Shut up!

667
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:24,553
I can't watch this.

668
00:49:24,688 --> 00:49:28,096
- This is my fucking
business, okay?

669
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:34,097
- Richard, you don't
have to do this.

670
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:37,005
- Hey, it's his call, man.

671
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,902
- Make her do it,
she should do it.

672
00:49:39,037 --> 00:49:40,207
- Shut up!

673
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:43,738
- I can do this.

674
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,447
I can do this, let me do this.

675
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:54,249
She should be here.

676
00:49:54,384 --> 00:49:55,651
She shouldn't be dead.

677
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:03,291
- She shouldn't be dead.
- No.

678
00:50:03,427 --> 00:50:07,729
- But she is now, join her.

679
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:10,234
Yes.
- Yeah.

680
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,772
- You can kiss her.
- Yeah.

681
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:14,472
- Yeah, so do it.

682
00:50:23,783 --> 00:50:24,614
Oh.

683
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:28,486
Shh.

684
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:32,424
- Oh fuck.

685
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,495
Now look at me, look at me.

686
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,795
You'll be with her soon.

687
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:46,772
Go to sleep.

688
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,803
Sleep, Richard.

689
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:12,497
Thank you, Richard.

690
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:07,288
This is fucked up.

691
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,226
This is all so fucked.

692
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:16,627
I tried to kill
him just like her.

693
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:21,566
She's gonna kill us
all anyway, isn't she?

694
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:23,938
No, she isn't.

695
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,603
We just have to figure it out.

696
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:30,839
Hey L?
- Yeah.

697
00:52:32,614 --> 00:52:36,416
- Back there with Tracey,
what were you saying?

698
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,616
What do you mean?

699
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:40,382
- Sounded like scripture.

700
00:52:40,518 --> 00:52:42,721
How did you know all that?

701
00:52:42,856 --> 00:52:47,295
- Oh, that's, my Mom used to
take me to church every Sunday.

702
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,726
Do you still go?

703
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:52,927
- No, I stopped
going when I was 12.

704
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:59,637
It's weird though, I
still remember, you know.

705
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,678
- What does it all mean?

706
00:53:06,813 --> 00:53:12,221
- I think it just means
whatever you go through in life.

707
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:14,751
It's all just temporary.

708
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,753
It'll all pass.

709
00:53:42,651 --> 00:53:46,217
Sorry, Olivia, suicide
isn't the same as murder.

710
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:47,817
You're doing well though,

711
00:53:47,952 --> 00:53:50,786
learning the darker
side of human nature.

712
00:53:50,922 --> 00:53:55,296
You're almost there, but
if you want to escape

713
00:53:55,431 --> 00:53:58,361
you can't just let a
person take their life.

714
00:53:58,497 --> 00:53:59,829
You must take it from them.

715
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,658
When do you think that she's
going to make her move?

716
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:31,465
She'll probably
wait till it's dark.

717
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:35,566
Someone's going to die
when the lights go off.

718
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:37,735
She's the one that
stabbed Tracey.

719
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:41,739
Yeah, I think so too.

720
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:05,763
- I can hear everything
you're saying, you know.

721
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:11,637
This room is not very large.

722
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,310
You should know that by now.

723
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:20,345
- And you're right,
I killed her.

724
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:21,911
I thought she was you, Alice.

725
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:26,454
- Someone is going to die
when the lights go out.

726
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:30,854
But right now I'm still alive.

727
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:34,794
And so is the only
woman that I ever loved,

728
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:38,092
and I intend to do
whatever I have to do

729
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:42,531
to make sure that she
isn't going to die.

730
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,505
Olivia, it's not worth it.

731
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,009
Give yourself up to me, Sean.

732
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,021
I'm willing to have
sex with you first

733
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,820
if that's what you want.

734
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:11,432
I will be gentle
afterwards, I promise.

735
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,429
- Olivia, you're not
thinking clearly.

736
00:56:14,564 --> 00:56:15,831
- Yes, I am.

737
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,801
Everything is very
clear right now.

738
00:56:17,937 --> 00:56:20,838
Clearer than it has
ever been, really.

739
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,672
Olivia, we should all talk.

740
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:25,778
- I'm tired of talking, Sean.

741
00:56:26,781 --> 00:56:28,747
Come on, there has to be
another way out of here.

742
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:31,682
Look, we can use your
hatchet and my ax

743
00:56:31,818 --> 00:56:32,846
and we can chop
through the wall.

744
00:56:32,982 --> 00:56:34,549
We can still get out of here.

745
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,491
And go where, Sean?

746
00:56:37,158 --> 00:56:38,625
Go where?

747
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,188
You don't know what's
on the other side.

748
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:44,466
There's no way out of
here except one way.

749
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:46,435
No.

750
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,840
You're not a killer, Sean.

751
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:52,870
Look at you.

752
00:56:54,274 --> 00:56:56,071
Holding that ax.

753
00:56:57,212 --> 00:56:59,508
Olivia, just stop.

754
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:00,878
I'm not gonna fight you.

755
00:57:02,845 --> 00:57:05,883
Good, surrender to me.

756
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:09,751
- Olivia, please, don't do it.

757
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:12,527
Look, I'm gonna drop my weapon.

758
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:16,993
You have said too much.

759
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:21,265
You will never be the same.

760
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,438
- Olivia!

761
00:58:11,314 --> 00:58:12,915
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to push you

762
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:15,216
into becoming who
you really are.

763
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:25,665
If any of us is
pushed far enough

764
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:28,796
there's no telling what
we will do to survive,

765
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:30,671
so don't feel guilty.

766
00:58:31,472 --> 00:58:32,937
This is all my fault.

767
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:35,138
- I don't feel guilty.

768
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:39,511
I just know I did everything
I could to stay alive

769
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:41,546
and you did everything you could

770
00:58:41,682 --> 00:58:43,981
to drive that poor girl crazy.

771
00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:49,190
- And yet, Sean, you
surprised me today.

772
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:50,558
I thought you would give in

773
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,761
to such a beautiful
girl like Olivia.

774
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:57,593
I'm surprised you could
resist such a beautiful woman.

775
00:58:57,729 --> 00:58:59,535
What are you saying?

776
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,505
- I know everything
about you, Sean.

777
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,034
I know how you
brought another woman

778
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,972
into your bed when
your wife was away.

779
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,641
Where is my wife?

780
00:59:12,777 --> 00:59:14,176
Do you have my wife?

781
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:17,614
Of course not.

782
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,255
Why would I take your wife

783
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,653
when clearly you don't care much

784
00:59:22,788 --> 00:59:24,857
about whether she's hurt or not?

785
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:32,799
But, I have a person
that you really love.

786
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:36,033
- Jacob, oh my God, Jacob.

787
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:39,971
Jacob, are you okay?

788
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,304
Where's my boy?

789
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:45,647
Where's my boy?

790
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:50,915
- And L, you are not so
innocent either, are you?

791
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,247
The difference between
you and Sean is

792
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:55,923
you hurt the person
you love the most.

793
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,625
Remember, when you ran away
and you broke her heart?

794
01:00:00,761 --> 01:00:02,224
- What are you talking about?

795
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:10,331
Mom?

796
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:14,610
Leonard?

797
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,075
Mom, where are you?

798
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,276
Don't worry about me.

799
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,016
Are you hurt?

800
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:30,791
You know your Mama,
nothing can really hurt me.

801
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:34,355
Mama, I was gonna
come back home.

802
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:38,634
I'm gonna come get you.

803
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,296
I'm still gonna come back.

804
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:48,875
Final test, decide who
lives and who dies.

805
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,991
This is fucked up.

806
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:09,357
This is so fucked up.

807
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:20,267
We're all just gonna
end up dead like them.

808
01:01:20,403 --> 01:01:23,977
I mean, for all we
know they're forcing us

809
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:28,046
to kill each other but
my sister could be alive.

810
01:01:31,415 --> 01:01:33,984
I'm sorry, Alice, but
your sister's dead.

811
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,087
I'm not gonna let
her kill my son.

812
01:01:36,856 --> 01:01:38,285
- Even if my sister's dead

813
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:40,423
killing each other
isn't worth it.

814
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,359
We're all acting like animals
slaughtering each other.

815
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:48,165
She's right.

816
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:51,168
The doctor's not
even in here, man.

817
01:01:52,403 --> 01:01:54,940
We're the ones getting
our hands dirty.

818
01:01:55,075 --> 01:01:56,976
She hasn't laid a
finger on anyone.

819
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:11,452
Fucking Tracey,
she was pregnant.

820
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:15,889
She would have done
anything for her baby.

821
01:02:16,925 --> 01:02:20,627
Sean, I know you would have
done anything for your child.

822
01:02:20,762 --> 01:02:25,500
And L, I know your Mom
would do anything for you.

823
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,009
That doesn't mean that
we should keep playing.

824
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:33,013
When the timer goes off,
the lights are gonna go out

825
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,180
and she's going to want
for us to kill each other.

826
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,888
We're not going anywhere.

827
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:43,418
Might as well just stop.

828
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,272
Richard was right.

829
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:06,815
Richard was the only
one who was right.

830
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:10,478
He died with dignity.

831
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,848
He didn't kill anyone.

832
01:03:13,983 --> 01:03:15,384
Didn't even try.

833
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:20,328
- You know she's right, Sean.

834
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,094
I'm not gonna kill you.

835
01:03:22,229 --> 01:03:24,866
That's not what my Mom
would want anyways.

836
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:27,295
It's a dark road and I'm
not going down it, man.

837
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:29,064
- I don't want to
kill you either,

838
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:32,472
but my son, they got my son.

839
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,638
And I can't let him die.

840
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:37,009
My son is eight.

841
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:39,640
He hasn't had a
chance at life yet.

842
01:03:40,576 --> 01:03:44,612
I'm sorry, but I
gotta take you down.

843
01:03:44,747 --> 01:03:49,187
If there's even a chance of
saving him, I need to win.

844
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,223
I'll get you.

845
01:03:53,326 --> 01:03:56,157
You walk around smiling,
acting all in charge,

846
01:03:56,293 --> 01:03:57,465
acting like you're a good guy

847
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,032
till nobody's looking, man.

848
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:03,067
Yeah, I'm not that
great of a guy, okay.

849
01:04:03,203 --> 01:04:05,804
But that little
boy there, he is.

850
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,173
He got cancer when he was six.

851
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:10,471
We were told that he
only had six months.

852
01:04:10,606 --> 01:04:13,310
His mother and I,
we fought for him.

853
01:04:15,947 --> 01:04:17,215
But you know what?

854
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,152
Our relationship got to
the point where she left

855
01:04:21,322 --> 01:04:24,822
and I met someone to
help me take my mind away

856
01:04:24,957 --> 01:04:27,026
if just for a moment.

857
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:30,893
I made a mistake and
I'm still sorry for it.

858
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:32,329
- Well, congratulations.

859
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,562
I'm a fuck up, okay?

860
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:41,107
I admit it, but my son,
he's better than I am.

861
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:44,209
I'm not going to let
some crazy lady kill him.

862
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:46,746
You all may not think
that I'm a survivor

863
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:48,616
but you know what, my son is.

864
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:51,052
And I'm not gonna let him die.

865
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,988
Yeah, we'll see when
the lights go off.

866
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,094
- What about me, Sean?

867
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,124
If you kill L, does that mean
you're going to kill me too?

868
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:04,527
You lost your sister.

869
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,998
You should do what Richard did

870
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:10,066
and take yourself out of this.

871
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:11,400
- You know what I said before

872
01:05:11,535 --> 01:05:13,808
about how we shouldn't
play anymore?

873
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,341
I've changed my mind.
- What?

874
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:19,779
- I've changed my mind.
I want to kill you, Sean,

875
01:05:19,914 --> 01:05:22,042
if it's the last thing I do.

876
01:05:22,177 --> 01:05:24,014
Watch it, Alice.

877
01:05:24,149 --> 01:05:26,151
Watch it, you stay out of this.

878
01:05:26,286 --> 01:05:28,755
- No, I'm in this
more now than ever

879
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,524
and I'm ready for you, Sean.

880
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,158
- You don't get it, man.

881
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,024
You know how much anger it takes

882
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,524
for people like us to survive?

883
01:05:37,298 --> 01:05:39,099
Man, you think 'cause
you killed some girl

884
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,662
that was chasing after
you with an ax first,

885
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,400
you can understand what
it takes to survive, man?

886
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:45,371
You don't know shit!

887
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:48,235
Every day of my life has
been about survival for me

888
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,678
and the people that I love.

889
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:51,845
Today isn't any different for me

890
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,713
just because I'm
stuck here, man.

891
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,146
Today's just another day,

892
01:05:55,282 --> 01:05:56,278
just another day
where I don't know

893
01:05:56,413 --> 01:05:57,885
if me or anybody
else that I love

894
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:59,247
is gonna make it
through tomorrow.

895
01:05:59,383 --> 01:06:00,648
So welcome to my world, Sean.

896
01:06:00,783 --> 01:06:03,156
This is what's always
like for me, man.

897
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:09,558
- You really think that you
can beat me with that knife?

898
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:16,433
Hey L, Sean's right about me.

899
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:21,669
I've got nothing
left to live for,

900
01:06:22,976 --> 01:06:24,441
but I'm still angry.

901
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,411
That's still there.

902
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:31,244
And I don't want to
see you win, Sean,

903
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,681
even if it means I die.

904
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,387
You want to know why?

905
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,325
I just don't like you.

906
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:48,068
That's not fair,
Alice, that's not fucking fair.

907
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:51,334
- Shut up, people
like you always win.

908
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,205
- It's not fair, that's
not fucking fair.

909
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:56,473
It ain't Alice you
gotta worry about, Sean.

910
01:06:59,044 --> 01:07:00,114
- Come on, L.

911
01:07:01,245 --> 01:07:03,013
Okay, I'm not a killer.

912
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:04,245
I'm just a dad, okay?

913
01:07:04,381 --> 01:07:06,015
I just want to save my kid.

914
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,452
Please, just let me win.

915
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:12,122
- Where are you going, Sean?

916
01:07:12,258 --> 01:07:14,429
Kill him, L!
- I will.

917
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:15,492
- Come on!

918
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:35,215
- No, no I can't!

919
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,153
No, no!

920
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,818
- Get off me!

921
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,129
Alice!

922
01:07:53,397 --> 01:07:55,065
Thank you for helping me, Alice.

923
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:58,106
- No Sean, don't do this.

924
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,647
You tried to kill me.

925
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,040
- I didn't touch you.

926
01:08:07,175 --> 01:08:10,710
Yeah, but you gave him a
machete so he could kill me.

927
01:08:10,846 --> 01:08:14,116
No! Seriously,
stop Sean, please.

928
01:08:14,252 --> 01:08:15,616
We're past that, Alice.

929
01:08:15,752 --> 01:08:18,252
I'm not gonna debate
this with you.

930
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:19,588
What about your son?

931
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:21,695
What kind of example
are you setting?

932
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:23,229
- My son is dead!

933
01:08:23,364 --> 01:08:27,999
Choked, lifeless,
but you know what?

934
01:08:28,135 --> 01:08:29,868
We're all survivors, right?

935
01:08:30,004 --> 01:08:31,165
Is that right, huh?

936
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,404
All of us!

937
01:08:33,404 --> 01:08:38,608
You, L, Richard, Olivia, Tracey,

938
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:41,380
we're all survivors!

939
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:45,083
You know what, it's
just that some of us

940
01:08:45,219 --> 01:08:46,615
are better at it than others.

941
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,382
Yeah, but you don't
have to kill me,

942
01:08:48,518 --> 01:08:50,154
you don't have to do this.

943
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,255
We can still get out of here.

944
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:55,262
I'm done talking to you, Alice.

945
01:08:58,361 --> 01:08:59,392
Shut the fuck up!

946
01:08:59,528 --> 01:09:01,569
Shut the fuck up, L.

947
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:02,665
- Please stop!

948
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:04,970
Sean!

949
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:09,236
Shh, shh, come on, Alice!

950
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:14,009
Alice!

951
01:09:14,144 --> 01:09:15,381
Alice!

952
01:09:20,348 --> 01:09:21,387
Alice.

953
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,990
Alice.

954
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,146
You fucking bitch.

955
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,644
I'd rather be a
bitch than a corpse.

956
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,687
What are you doing?

957
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:35,125
Don't you have any decency?

958
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:37,899
- I do Alice, I do,

959
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,296
but not everyone has the luxury.

960
01:10:40,432 --> 01:10:41,935
You must conclude the test.

961
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,737
You have no other choice.

962
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:44,833
You must go on.

963
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:48,105
- Just do it.

964
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:49,574
Just do it, just leave.

965
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,011
- No, I'm going to get
you out of here, okay?

966
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,381
I'm going to get you out.

967
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,486
- Alice, you gotta leave.

968
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:03,289
- No, I'm going to get
you out of here, okay?

969
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,721
Don't worry, I'm
gonna get you out.

970
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:06,793
You're gonna carry me
right out that door?

971
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,362
- Yeah, yeah.

972
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,136
Alice you gotta do this,

973
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:20,902
you gotta end this.

974
01:11:25,642 --> 01:11:27,815
- Alice, you gotta leave.

975
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:28,946
Just do it, alright?

976
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,284
- No.

977
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,453
I won't leave you,
I won't leave you.

978
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:38,121
- I will soon.

979
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:40,328
- No, no, no.

980
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:50,030
Please, L. Stay with me.

981
01:11:57,711 --> 01:12:01,410
- There is a dark side
to obedience, Alice.

982
01:12:01,546 --> 01:12:03,648
Thank you for showing me.

983
01:12:03,783 --> 01:12:06,816
I have learned more
than I ever wanted to.

984
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:13,020
Fuck you!

985
01:12:23,538 --> 01:12:26,566
- Alice, you have
no other choice.

986
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:27,969
You must kill him.

987
01:12:36,746 --> 01:12:38,886
You have made it this far.

988
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,651
You have to end it.

989
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:43,583
Please embrace the
animal inside you.

990
01:12:43,718 --> 01:12:45,019
You must continue.

991
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,829
- I'm not going to,
I'm not going to.

992
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,768
Then you will die together.

993
01:13:04,744 --> 01:13:08,676
- Alice, Alice?
- No, no, no, no.

994
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:11,850
Look at me, Alice, look at me.

995
01:13:12,786 --> 01:13:17,187
You have to do this
to save yourself, ok?

996
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:18,022
- Kill me.

997
01:13:18,157 --> 01:13:18,987
Do it.

998
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:24,861
- Just close your eyes.

999
01:13:26,463 --> 01:13:27,901
Go to sleep.

1000
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:36,966
Hello?

1001
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:39,936
Can you hear me?

1002
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:57,321
No, no!

1003
01:14:57,457 --> 01:15:00,453
No, let me out of here!

1004
01:15:00,588 --> 01:15:01,958
No!

1005
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:25,811
waited for you

1006
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:39,891
call the choirs

1007
01:17:23,267 --> 01:17:28,676
made of love
