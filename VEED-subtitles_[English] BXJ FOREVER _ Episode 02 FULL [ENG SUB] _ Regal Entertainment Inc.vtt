00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.092
Jim it's you.

2
00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.433
Today is the day that I will never let go of you

3
00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.462
Jim, you should know when it’s time to hold on

4
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.380
or when it’s time to let go.

5
00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.965
You know what, some good things

6
00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.551
will really come to an end
no matter how good they were.

7
00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.386
Enough of that sister,

8
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.639
your words are not helping.

9
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.100
But it’s the truth.

10
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.769
You always watch that,

11
00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.353
that’s why you get more depressed.

12
00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.397
Six months…

13
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.567
I will never get tired,

14
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.735
until we meet again.

15
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.011
Wow! Good job!

16
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.347
Nice! Nice!

17
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.186
Let's take a picture

18
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.103
Good job!

19
00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.438
I told you I can do this!

20
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:17.697
Okay, so “shoplift”, check.

21
00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.532
No, that’s not shoplifting,

22
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.451
that’s taking revenge on the capitalists.

23
00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:26.789
Wow. English again, very long English this time.

24
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.626
You’re beginning to sound like Ben.

25
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.089
That’s sad.

26
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.426
I thought we are doing this to move on from him,

27
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:43.139
but it seems like,
we are getting reminded of him more.

28
00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.308
Sorry, madame BFF.

29
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.101
It’s okay BFF.

30
00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.269
So, what’s next on my list.

31
00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:48.978
Oops, wait.

32
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:49.687
Wait.

33
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:51.773
Let me work the day first.

34
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.483
It’s too good to be wasted.

35
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.486
But we have an appointment later,

36
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.820
we promised Babe.

37
00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.113
I know,

38
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.451
but let me work first so I can bring home

39
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.453
something to my nineteen siblings.

40
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.122
You have a lot of siblings,

41
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.041
unlike me, alone.

42
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:11.834
You’re not alone.

43
00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:15.505
I’m here, you’re one and only BFF.

44
00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:18.130
So, where do you want me to take you?

45
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:20.341
To the mall.

46
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:24.514
I’m gonna do this “slap a Karen without a warning”.

47
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.976
Wow, to the mall again,

48
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.812
you always get a free ride, thanks to me.

49
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.397
Come on.

50
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.693
Let’s go.

51
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.154
Hey, I’ll go ahead.
Hey, I’ll go ahead.

52
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.322
I’ll come back later.

53
00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.323
I’ll just go to the clinic.

54
00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:43.658
Why don’t you go home

55
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.577
so you can rest properly.

56
00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:48.162
Why? Am I not allowed here?

57
00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.163
I’m a paying customer.

58
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.541
Flo…

59
00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:55.837
thank you.

60
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.341
Bye!

61
00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:03.845
-Hey!
-Bro!

62
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:04.512
I’ll go ahead.

63
00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:06.889
You’re still here?

64
00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.890
I thought you already left.

65
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.891
What are you, a stalker?

66
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.435
Not a stalker,

67
00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.436
just an observer.

68
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.397
I was already introducing you a while ago---

69
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.023
I can do it myself!

70
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.109
At my own pace and time.

71
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.569
I can.

72
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.477
Yes, young boy?

73
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:53.394
Huh?

74
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:54.395
No,

75
00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.105
I’m not following you.

76
00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.732
I’m just waiting for a cab here.

77
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.941
Don’t be assuming.

78
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.611
So, it’s me who’s assuming now huh.

79
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.696
Wait!

80
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:04.906
Wait!

81
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.450
Let me take you home.

82
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.244
Why? Do you have a car?

83
00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:35.812
[So, hello guys!]

84
00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.021
[This is Jim Alcantara.]

85
00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.607
[And to those who don't believe...]

86
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:41.776
[Yes.]

87
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.363
[I know this man here, Ben Mendoza.]

88
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:07.255
Hey, how are you?

89
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.430
Hey, how are you?

90
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:17.682
I’m coming home.

91
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.603
Are you still staying next door?

92
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.788
Yes. How are you? Haha.

93
00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:44.959
Delete message for everyone?

94
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:46.460
Confirm

95
00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:53.467
Message deleted

96
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:11.819
The next time we see each other,

97
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:15.323
I’d be politically correct,

98
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:19.160
but no longer a politician’s son.

99
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:34.258
Jim, if you’re leaving and not sleeping here,

100
00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.343
lock the store okay.

101
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:37.094
Yes ma’am.

102
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:37.762
Okay.

103
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.227
Hello, Babe?

104
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.188
Okay.

105
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.356
Yes, I’m about to close the store.

106
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:49.231
Okay.

107
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:52.526
Wait.

108
00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:54.528
Sir.

109
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.198
Sir, we are closed already.

110
00:10:59.033 --> 00:10:59.533
Sir.

111
00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.577
The customer is always right.

112
00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:06.207
Can I have one Caramel Macchiato please?

113
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.258
Excuse me sir.

114
00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:46.789
How is it?

115
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.791
Almost done, Sir.

116
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.639
Is that everything, Sir?

117
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:04.682
Nothing else.

118
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:07.101
Aren’t you the one who went viral?

119
00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.855
You confessed your love to someone,

120
00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:12.606
how are you now?

121
00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:19.029
Sir, just call me if you need anything else.

122
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.282
Pathetic.

123
00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:59.820
Do you want me to go there
and drag him out of this place?

124
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.074
Stop it BFF, if Ben were here,
he'd be mad at you.

125
00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.494
It’s like he’s doing it on purpose.

126
00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:09.497
The customer is always right.

127
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:13.667
The customer should always be treated right,

128
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:14.668
that’s the correct one.

129
00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:15.669
That’s English!

130
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.837
Good job!

131
00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.756
Where’s Rica?

132
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.758
Do you want to postpone this first?

133
00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.219
It seems like that.

134
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:26.347
So, what now?

135
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.183
Let’s go. We waited too long already.

136
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:33.103
Bye.

137
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:34.730
Take care.

138
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:35.940
Excuse me.

139
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:37.107
Bill out please.

140
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:22.820
Benny, wherever you are,

141
00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:25.739
we hope that you are happy.

142
00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.578
Go online please. Let’s chat sometime.

143
00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:33.664
There’s no signal there.

144
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.752
We miss you, Benny.

145
00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.759
Someday, wifey.

146
00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.433
The stars will align for us.

147
00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:43.359
Thank you, Bro.

148
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.485
I’m envious of your car.

149
00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:47.488
Anytime, Bro.

150
00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.324
Take care.

151
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.095
How did you get in?

152
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:25.437
How about you?

153
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.438
Do you have a boyfriend?

154
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.275
None, Mr. Host.

155
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.364
I just think of my career as of the moment.

156
00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:43.789
[Funny Meme]

157
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.212
[Who’s this?]

158
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:50.879
Where to?

159
00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:52.422
So, your place or my place?

160
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:53.340
Oh, Sir.

161
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.341
You won’t do it yet.

162
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:55.551
You can start by getting to know each other first.

163
00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:56.927
Of course, in times like this,

164
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.178
it’s not good to be alone.

165
00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.347
You should always have assurance, always ready.

166
00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:01.306
How about you? Are you always ready?

167
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:02.349
Are you “power”?

168
00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:03.559
You’re handsome.

169
00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:05.561
Thank you.

170
00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:08.105
And you’re beautiful.

171
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.731
Actually, I don’t matter here,

172
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:10.732
I’ll be leaving soon.

173
00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:11.733
You two have fun.

174
00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:14.236
Wait! I’m still waiting for someone.

175
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.621
Is that what you do all day?

176
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:26.623
Cry over someone you weren’t able to fight for?

177
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.458
That’s not how you mend a broken heart, honey.

178
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.586
It’s not the world’s fault that you got cancelled.

179
00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:31.753
Is that how it is now?

180
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.967
Once you’re wrong, he’s wrong forever.
