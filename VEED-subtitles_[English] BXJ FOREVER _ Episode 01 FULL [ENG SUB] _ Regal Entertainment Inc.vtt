00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:46.838
Jim it's you

2
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.601
Today,

3
00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.150
Today is the day that I will never let go of you

4
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.655
I've wasted so much time already

5
00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.367
There were a lot of doubts in the past

6
00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:29.089
There were a lot of moments we failed to cherish

7
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.177
Because we cower,

8
00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.014
we are afraid

9
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.192
But today, not anymore

10
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:41.823
[The vaccination roll out is successful]

11
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.199
[with the initiative of the business community]

12
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.202
[and the Vice President herself Miriam Salumbides,]

13
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:50.290
[at the same time the decrease of
 Covid-19 cases in the country.]

14
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.376
[The public is less worried
 but many are still careful.]

15
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.379
[The World Health Organization reminds
 the public to remain]

16
00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.299
[vigilant even if the country has slowly
 returned to normal, and]

17
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.844
[more lenient safety protocols
 are being implemented.]

18
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.650
Hey!

19
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.777
Are you okay?

20
00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.446
Don’t sleep there or Sir Rica will see you

21
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.781
Your break is over

22
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.158
How about you, is your shift done?

23
00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.577
Yes…

24
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.580
and I have a date

25
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.166
With who?

26
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.971
Hi, Flo

27
00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.514
You’re just in time

28
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.141
Where do you want to go?

29
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.457
Kid!

30
00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:38.875
Excuse me?

31
00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.174
Hey…

32
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.467
are you closing shift today?

33
00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:49.010
What about our appointment later?

34
00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:50.887
I already asked for permission

35
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.014
But, to whom can I hitch?

36
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.016
I’m trying to save money

37
00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.893
Send a message to Olan

38
00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.188
I don’t have social media, remember?

39
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.272
Then send a text instead

40
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:09.906
So, date?

41
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.491
Calm down

42
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.910
She’s going to be my girlfriend,

43
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.038
trust me

44
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.206
Okay, alright…

45
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.207
I’ll trust your words

46
00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:27.131
Hey Jim, I allowed you to take tomorrow off,

47
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:28.424
but you have to render overtime later

48
00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:30.426
We have a visitor coming

49
00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:32.720
Yes ma’am

50
00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:51.531
[Today, I will do something that
 I should have done before.]

51
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.075
[I'm doing this for you.]

52
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.329
[I was asking you to be unselfish.]

53
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.957
[But, I din't have the time to self-check.]

54
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.335
<font color=#FFB71EFF>[I am the one who also need to be selfless.]</font>

55
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.087
You always watch that,

56
00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:08.256
that’s why you get more depressed

57
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.091
<font color=#FFB71EFF>[Because, I didn't take risk like you did.]</font>

58
00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:11.259
Six months…

59
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.302
I will never get tired,

60
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:14.595
until we meet again
 [So, I am sorry.]

61
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.974
You know what, to help you move on,

62
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.559
I'll introduce you to one of my friends

63
00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:20.768
He's cute
 [and no lies.]

64
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:27.984
Hello?

65
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.570
So, son, when will you give up?

66
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.572
I'm telling you, nothing will Happen to your---

67
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:36.993
Wooh

68
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.203
You really have a terrible back story, haven’t you?

69
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.122
Look at me,

70
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.375
just a college dropout, no future

71
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.002
Simple. Right?

72
00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:48.796
Hello!

73
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:49.797
Yo! Jim!

74
00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:50.798
-Hey Bogs!
 -Hey!

75
00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:52.216
What’s up?

76
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.593
Still here

77
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.219
Hey, let’s go!

78
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:00.683
Come inside

79
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:11.402
Here you go. Thank you

80
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:13.821
Aren’t you Jimson Alcantara?

81
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:15.323
Can we take a picture?

82
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.700
I’m still at work

83
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:18.826
It’s not allowed

84
00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:19.326
It’s not allowed

85
00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:20.703
Alright, thank you

86
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.624
Snotty, that’s why he’s cancelled

87
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.712
Go ahead, Jim

88
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.422
Take a break for 5 minutes

89
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.051
Thank you

90
00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:42.558
What’s up?

91
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.353
Bro, I asked for an update

92
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.854
from my friend from Quezon Province,

93
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.274
sadly, there’s nothing new yet

94
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.194
You know guys, if he’s gone,

95
00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.362
we won’t be able to find him anymore

96
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:56.864
Don’t be negative sister,

97
00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:00.076
you’re removing hope for him

98
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.453
I’m not removing his hope

99
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.581
Jim, you should know when it’s time to hold on

100
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.084
or when it’s time to let go

101
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.877
Stop that, Francia

102
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.879
Let’s just help him

103
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.298
We’re friends with Ben anyway,

104
00:11:14.298 --> 00:11:16.384
we should at least have care for him

105
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.887
Bogs, I’m just being brutally honest

106
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.223
Everything is messed up since the beginning

107
00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.892
You guys always believe in fairy tales

108
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.103
You know what, some good things

109
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:30.106
will really come to an end
 no matter how good they were

110
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:31.899
Enough of that sister,

111
00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:35.111
your words are not helping

112
00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.488
But it’s the truth

113
00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:41.325
But it’s not the right time to say it

114
00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:46.122
Be sensitive sometimes

115
00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.915
Don’t be agitated all the time,

116
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.792
we’re not your antagonists here

117
00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:03.514
Hey, Dante. I thought you got a date with her?

118
00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:16.777
Nothing, I’m just teasing him

119
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.362
Date..

120
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.448
So anyway,

121
00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.950
Bogs, Francia, see you tonight?

122
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.371
I’m sorry, I can’t

123
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.290
I have early work tomorrow

124
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.877
Skipping work means salary deduction

125
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.546
I have rent to pay

126
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.300
As usual, he can’t join again

127
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.469
Good thing you’re joining us sister

128
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:43.971
I can’t too, sister

129
00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.556
We will be early tomorrow

130
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:49.685
You know, there’s still a lot of congressmen

131
00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:52.855
who are still against SOGIE Equality Bill

132
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.483
Bye, girl

133
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.318
Bye, sis

134
00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.319
Let’s go guys

135
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.866
Don’t worry…

136
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.576
Olan confirmed they’re joining us

137
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.252
I thought we are doing this to move on from him,

138
00:13:56.877 --> 00:14:01.257
but it seems like,
 we are getting reminded of him more

139
00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:04.552
Yes, young boy?

140
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.052
Huh?

141
00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:05.928
No,

142
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:07.721
I’m not following you

143
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.265
I’m just waiting for a cab here

144
00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:10.474
Don’t be assuming

145
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.060
So, it’s me who’s assuming now huh

146
00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:18.983
The next time we see each other, I’d be politically correct,
 but no longer a politician’s son

147
00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.276
Hello, Babe?

148
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.069
Okay

149
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.404
Yes, I’m about to close the store

150
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:24.321
Okay

151
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.324
Wait

152
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:29.702
Sir

153
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.121
Sir, we are closed already

154
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.622
Aren’t you the one who went viral?

155
00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.333
You confessed your love to someone,

156
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.043
how are you now?

157
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.838
Sir, just call me if you need anything else

158
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:42.715
Pathetic
